In my home office I have a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad. When I use my MacBook Air elsewhere in the house I constantly see connect and disconnect messages for these devices. Frequently toggling BT on/off can be a pain; the menu bar method for toggling BT requires scanning the menu bar for the BT glyph, clicking on it, finding the correct menu item and clicking on it. All that scanning, tracking, and clicking can be disruptive to a good mental flow; I wanted a quick keyboard shortcut to toggle bluetoooth on/off. I use [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) and after a quick search I found [this](http://seapy.com/1779) extension that does just that. I use “bt” as the shortcut code. I have found this to be very handy, I now toggle out of habit, so no thinking required;
