<p>I changed my desk out for a workbench last January and am very pleased with the results. I made the switch for a two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I spend a lot of time at my desk and wanted to mix in sitting and standing throughout the day.</li>
<li>I started to work more frequently on small hardware projects and found that being able to stand and move about the bench was more comfortable.</li>
</ol>


<p>A few additional changes I made:</p>

<ul>
<li>I found that I needed more tools at hand when I was working on hardware projects, so I brought in a small tool cabinet from the garage.</li>
<li>I wanted to have access to a large number of &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; materials in my office vs. the garage, so I also added an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40196241/" target="_blank">IKEA Alex</a> cabinet. These can often be found in their discount section for around $60 if you don&rsquo;t mind a few minor marks. This cabinet holds larger hardware components (like Arduino boards) as well as design/art supplies like paper, ink, paint, cutting/carving tools, etc.</li>
<li>I wanted to have some smaller supplies at hand on top of the desk so I added a few <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AIDBGC" target="_blank">Art Supply Drawers</a> for the top of the bench. The one to the left of the monitor holds small electronic components, the one to the right holds drawing pencils, pens, markers, etc that I use frequently.</li>
<li>I added a <a href="//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ANZRT4M" target="_blank">digital soldering station</a> and added an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weller-WSA350-Bench-Smoke-Absorber/dp/B000EM74SK" target="_blank">exhaust fan</a>. I still have a soldering station in the garage, but having one at hand is very convenient.</li>
<li>Another handy addition is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XNYXQHE" target="_blank">USB Microscope</a> as some solder joints just require very careful inspection, especially with small components and SMD components.</li>
<li>I also had to add a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMJXD2" target="_blank">bench height chair</a>.</li>
<li>The workbench is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gladiator-GAWB08HWEG-Adjustable-Hardwood-Workbench/dp/B00ZTH82CW" target="_blank">Gladiator 8 ft. Maple Workbench</a> I had in the garage for a long time. The new ones allow height adjustment, and there are also less expensive bamboo top options.</li>
</ul>


<p>So far I have been very pleased with the setup. One nice feature is the workbench depth is less than a traditional desk, so I gained some space back in the office. The main benefit is just better productivity, I find certain tasks are just easier to accomplish when standing. The final benefit is, with two greyhounds in the house having a tall desk means fewer expensive pens and markers go missing.</p>
