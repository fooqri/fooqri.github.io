<p>Using Google spreadsheets is a great way for a team to collaborate on a data set but it leaves a bit to be desired on presentation of the data. To that end I will be creating a series of fun examples showing how to build small interactive apps that utilize <em>Google Docs</em> and <em>Polymer</em> web components to quickly bring data to life. In this series I will be using a Google spreadsheet as the data source, but other data sources are possible, and I will get to those as well in future posts.</p>

<p>The first example is  <strong><em><a href="http://fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dgyFhkQ9M8e">Hipster List</a></em></strong>, an app that shows cool places to visit in various cities. Check out the <strong><em><a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">README</a></em></strong> document for details on how this app is put together.</p>

<p><a href="http://fooqri.github.io//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdHRaTlI3Y2EydllTa2NsRjlxRVhMRlE&usp=sharing#gid=0"><img class="spreadsheet-screen" src="http://fooqri.github.io//s3.amazonaws.com/goddip-poggs/pgyUYTfcMUe/spreadsheet_screen.png"></a></p>

<p>A little convention is used to make it work. Namely, I use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdHRaTlI3Y2EydllTa2NsRjlxRVhMRlE&amp;usp=sharing">Hipster Hot Spots</a> Google spreadsheet, where each city&rsquo;s data is represented by a tab in the spreadsheet. There is also a <em>key</em> tab that provides a list of all the cities in the spreadsheet and the tab id (<em>gid</em>) for each city&rsquo;s data. The app will load its data from the spreadsheet and populate the city drop-down list of <em>hot spots</em>, and display a map with markers for each <em>hot spot</em>. This was a fun first example, remember to checkout the <a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">readme document</a> for code and explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I enabled url fragment parameters so you can easily point the app at your own copy of the spreadsheet for testing. See the <a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">readme document</a> for the how-to instructions. Feel free to copy the spreadsheet and try out the app with your own list of cities and <em>hot spots</em>.</p>

<p> Separating code and data is always beneficial, but there is something cool about connecting an app to a Google spreadsheet. There are many spreadsheet users who would like to have an app to visualize their data, but may not be up to the coding challenge yet. I think many small useful apps could be built this way;  I will pick a few to build in the next few weeks and discuss them here. I am using the <em><a href="//www.poggr.com/home">poggr.com</a></em> service for the example, which is a service I built just for these types of small quick apps that can rely on an external data service. It is basically working to merge interactive content creation and blogging into a single service.</p>

<p> Leave me a comment if you have an small spreadsheet driven app you would like me to build. If it seems reasonable I may add it to the list.</p>
