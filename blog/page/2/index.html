  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/rwx-blog/popup_workbench1.JPG"  style="height: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<p>We are down to one car, as we can walk/bike to about anything we could possibly need including caltrain and light rail. So the garage is now empty of cars, and filled with toys. While playing ping pong one day I decided a beverage table would be nice in the garage, but something that could also serve as a work surface in a pinch. Something to put some tools on, etc. I wanted it to be something that could be folded out of the way when not needed, and something that didn&rsquo;t cost a lot since I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it would really prove useful. Sort of a prototype 1 of a collapsable work surface concept.</p>

<p>I had some left over bamboo flooring from an old home improvement project that I thought would make a great table top, and I always have a few sheets of plywood around. All I was missing was the folding legs. After some searching I found some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LGBZC4G" target="_blank">Folding Shelf Bench Brackets</a>. I ordered 2 and installed them into a couple of wall studs in the garage and mounted a plywood top. I then cut and glued the strand bamboo flooring to the top to make a nice hard surface.</p>

<p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/rwx-blog/popup_workbench2.JPG"  style="height: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<p>For a true folding workbench something like <a href="http://goo.gl/lXKgtQ" target="_blank">this</a> looks very cool. If I decide I need something larger and more heavy duty I may go that route, but I have other benches already. I was looking for something that could add another table/work surface in a pinch in that particular location in the garage.</p>

<p>Now I also have a nice place to put cold drinks during ping pong matches.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a past post I showed a <a href="http://rwx.io/blog/2014/10/22/mobile-real-estate-app-version-1/">Mobile Real Estate App</a> that was built with Polymer. This time around I will revisit the app but instead use <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">react.js</a>. The <strong>Mobile Buyer&rsquo;s Agent</strong> is a simple web based application used to demonstrate a basic React.js mobile web app.The goal is to allows a real estate buyer&rsquo;s agent to deliver a personalized mobile app experience to their clients by adding data to a Google spreadsheet. The agent updates a Google spreadsheet, and the web app loads its data from the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.poggr.com/p-kz3NoHhgl:dZkIM34sBnlx?sheetid=1kv5haqhS8bUY_6IoJ6KBY5j42pN2WsY_wscDZSHb_m9" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/fooqri-poggs/p-kz3NoHhgl/buyers_agent_1.png"></a></p>

<p>This is a demonstration of using a shared <em>Google Spreadsheet</em>  as the data source for a simple web based application. By using poggr.com and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React.js</a> it is extremely easy to create a web application like the <strong><em><a href="http://www.poggr.com/p-kz3NoHhgl:dZkIM34sBnlx?sheetid=1kv5haqhS8bUY_6IoJ6KBY5j42pN2WsY_wscDZSHb_m9" target="_blank">Mobile Buyer&rsquo;s Agent</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>Real Estate Shopper List</em> Google spreadsheet contains properties the agent wishes to present in the app. The neighborhood column is associated with the dropdown box, and allows a simple grouping/categorization of properties. The agent also provides other features and details associated with the properties.</p>

<p><a href="//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kv5haqhS8bUY_6IoJ6KBY5j42pN2WsY_wscDZSHb_m8/pubhtml" target="_blank"><img class="spreadsheet-screen" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/fooqri-poggs/p-kz3NoHhgl/buyers_agent2.png" ></a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you duplicate the example spreadsheet you must remember to publish it so it can be accessed by the <em>Mobile Buyer&rsquo;s Agent</em> app. If you get an error it is likely you forgotto publish the spreadsheet. To publish a spreadsheet while viewing it, use the file menu on Google Docs and choose <em>&ldquo;publish to the web&rdquo;</em>, and follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>Trying your own spreadsheet</h3>

<p>If you publish your own copy of the spreadsheet you can easily substitute it in the app with a simple url parameter called <strong>sheetid</strong>.</p>

<p>For example if the link your are given when you plublish your spreadsheet is</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kv5haqhS8bUY_6IoJ6KBY5j42pN2WsY_wscDZSHb_m8/pubhtml</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then your sheetid is <strong>1kv5haqhS8bUY_6IoJ6KBY5j42pN2WsY_wscDZSHb_m8</strong>, and you can use it in this app by using a url with sheetid parameter as shown below:</p>

<p><code style="white-space: nowrap;">po.gg/p-kz3NoHhgl:dZkIM34sBnlx?sheetid=1kv5haqhS8bUY_6IoJ6KBY5j42pN2WsY_wscDZSHb_m8</code></p>

<p>This will substitue your spreadsheet for the default spreadsheet used in the app.</p>

<p>For info on the code take a look at the <a href="http://www.poggr.com/p-kz3NoHhgl:dbJMG3EjSneg" target="_blank">README</a> document.</p>

<p>The Edison is a tiny and amazing computer, and ideal prototyping tool for wearable and IoT experiments. Here are the steps I am currently following to set up the Edison.</p>

<h2>Flashing the Edison</h2>

<p>Like many developers I have Mac, Windows, and Linux laptops but I find that Linux is the best environment for flashing the Edison, even though I do most development on my Mac. I came to this conclusion after trying to recover an Edison with a lost password, the only platform that worked was Linux.</p>

<p>The first step is flashing the Edison. Follow <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23200">Flashing Edison Linux</a>. You can also try <a href="https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23193">Flashing Edison Mac</a>.</p>

<p>The only change I would recommend is to create a folder that contains the Edison images, and then unzip the downloaded folder into a sub directory named after the build number. Over time you may find yourself flashing to older or newer images based on the project needs.</p>

<h2>Setting up WiFi</h2>

<p>Sparkfun offers a great guide for <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/edison-getting-started-guide#connecting-to-WiFi">Setting up WiFi</a> on the Edison. This takes only a few minutes and even if you don&rsquo;t plan to use WiFi in your projects it makes working with the Edison easier because you can use SCP and SSH to connect with the Edison over the network.</p>

<h2>Connect to Edison</h2>

<p>For OSX or Linux the best way to connect to the Edison is via SSH. On OSX you can use the name you gave the Edison in the step above. For example <em>ssh root@edison2.local</em> where <em>edison2</em> is the name you gave your Edison. On Linux you will use the Edison&rsquo;s IP address, for example <em>ssh root@10.0.1.12</em>.</p>

<h2>Using Emacs</h2>

<p>If you are an Emacs user then once WiFi is setup you can use <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">Emacs Tramp</a> to work with files on the Edison. Just use <em>C-x C-f</em> as usual, but instead of a directory use <em>root@edison2.local</em> or use the ip address for Linux.</p>

<p>Emacs will present a directory of files on the Edison that you can open, or just keep typing the name for auto suggest feature. For example <em>root@edison2.local/home/root/notes.md</em>.</p>

<h2>Setup Bluetooth</h2>

<p>Bluetooth is available in the Edison, but in the default configuration is not enabled at boot. If you are using Bluetooth you will likely want to enable it on every reboot or power cycle.</p>

<h3>Enable Bluetooth at Boot</h3>

<p>Use the <strong>systemctl</strong> command to cause Bluetooth to start automatically</p>

<pre><code> systemctl enable bluetooth
</code></pre>

<h3>Create a BT startup script</h3>

<p>Create a script file with the following five lines (<em>/home/root/btup.sh</em>).</p>

<pre><code> #!/bin/sh
 /usr/sbin/rfkill unblock bluetooth
 /usr/bin/hciconfig hci0 up
 /usr/bin/hciconfig hci0 piscan
 /usr/bin/hciconfig hic0 sspmode 0
</code></pre>

<h3>Make the script executable</h3>

<pre><code> chmod +x /home/root/btup.sh
</code></pre>

<h3>Create a new service file (<em>/lib/systemd/system/btup.service</em>).</h3>

<pre><code> [Unit]
 Description=BTUP
 After=bluetooth.target
 Before=systemd-user-sessions.service
 [Service]
 Type=simple
 RemainAfterExit=true
 ExecStart=/home/root/btup.sh
 Environment="HOME=/home/root"
 WorkingDirectory=/home/root/
 [Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<h3>Enable the service</h3>

<pre><code> systemctl enable /lib/systemd/system/btup.service
</code></pre>

<h3>Reboot the Edison</h3>

<pre><code> reboot
</code></pre>

<h2>Create a Backup</h2>

<p>Now is a good time to create a backup of the Edison that can be recovered if you need to return to a clean install. For example you may want to update nodejs, or install node modules, or even other drivers that may cause an issue you want to start over from.</p>

<p>Place a MicroSD card with at least 4GB of available space into the MicroSD slot on the dev kit board where the Edison is installed. Backup the Edison to an image file on the MicroSD. In the example below it is named <em>edison2_backup.img</em>. Make sure the file name has a <em>.img</em> extension. If you have a large MicroSD card you can store multiple backup images from multiple Edisons, making it quick and easy to recover each of them. It is wise to consider a consistent naming system.</p>

<pre><code> dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/sdcard/edison2_bk.img
</code></pre>

<h2>Restoring an Edison from Backup</h2>

<p> If you need to restore the Edison from backup just reverse the process</p>

<pre><code> dd if=/media/sdcard/edison2_bk.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the challenges of building small mobile web apps without a traditional back-end server is storing global state in a secure way. In my exploration of ways to store state I decided to build a very simple multi-player social app that allows players to participate in a simple photo challenge game. The game author specifies a <em>photo caption</em> and then invites friends to add photo responses that <em>most creatively</em> match the caption. The second feature is to allow people to vote on their favorite photo responses.</p>

<p><a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/peJE7qM0YUl" target="_blank"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/fooqri-poggs/peJE7qM0YUl/static/images/peJE7qM0YUl_screen.png"  style="height: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a></p>

<p>Such a game would typically require a server to support a few key behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>player login</strong>: is needed to connect players with their uploaded photos, and also to limit their votes so as to keep voting fair.</li>
<li><strong>photo storage</strong>: photo upload and storage is needed to store the photos so they can be displayed when the page is loaded. In addition a back-end service is typically used to re-size uploaded images before storing them to reduce storage costs.</li>
<li><strong>global state</strong>: is generally provided by a database that stores information such as: which players have uploaded photos, and where the corresponding photos are located.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many challenges to running a back-end server to support an app, including configuration, maintenance, and security. In the ideal case one could build all sorts of small fun apps without having to manage any such servers. With the <strong>Photo Caption Challenge</strong> app I explored using the following services instead of running an app server.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>player login</strong>: I  used Facebook for player login as a way to differentiate players, and connect ids to votes and photos.</li>
<li><strong>photo storage</strong>: I used Amazon S3 for storing photos uploaded by players, and  used <em>canvas</em> and <em>canvas.toBlob()</em> (using <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/javascript-canvas-to-blob">JavaScript Canvas to Blob</a> polyfill) to re-size images and store them in a blob for upload to S3. Thus all image re-sizing is done in the client.</li>
<li><strong>global state</strong>: I used Amazon DynamoDB to provide state via a table that stores information about photo entries and votes.</li>
</ul>


<p>I  also used the Amazon IAM is the way to limit privileges from the client app to the data services (S3 and DynamoDB). For example you want the user to have write/delete access to only their information in the data services, but client API calls to the server can be manipulated, thus authentication information is critical to limiting privileges in accessing the data services.</p>

<p>IAM policies can specify an <em>identity provider</em> like Facebook to make sure to limit access based on current session identity information, and not the API request data. For example you can configure an IAM policy for S3 that secures S3 bucket privileges so that sub-folder privileges are connected to user identity. In the case of &ldquo;Photo Challenge&rdquo; the policy states any logged in Facebook user running the Photo Challenges app will be able to view photos in any sub-folder, but only upload, modify, or delete items that are in a folder that matches their identity provider&rsquo;s assigned userid. It also states that any user can create a folder in the bucket as long as the folder name matches their identity provider&rsquo;s assigned userid.</p>

<p>The Amazon IAM policy for DynamoDB works similarly. Any logged in Facebook user running the Photo Challenges app will be able to query the DB index for the current list of photo entries, but can only add/delete records that have a userId value that matches their identity provider&rsquo;s assigned userid. Thus a user can&rsquo;t spoof who added the record, it is connected to their userId or it is rejected by the IAM policy assigned to the DynamoDB table. For more information see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/FGAC_DDB.html">Fine-Grained Access Control for DynamoDB</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In <a href="http://octopress.dev/blog/2014/10/22/mobile-real-estate-app-version-1/">Mobile Real Estate App</a> and <a href="http://octopress.dev/blog/2014/10/15/spreadsheet-driven-web-apps/">Spreadsheet Driven Web Apps</a> I  described a technique for using a Google Spreadsheet to provide web application data, but this works best when the application data is read only. For an app that requires both read, write, and query transactions, a database like DynamoDB is a great solution.</p>

<p>Like many examples on this blog, I built this app using <em><a href="http://www.poggr.com">poggr.com</a></em> because poggs are incredibly flexible and require zero configuration.  Use this app at <a href="http://fooqri.poggr.com/peJE7qM0YUl:dxJ4NmcMAK8x">fooqri.po.gg/peJE7qM0YUl</a> or if you have a poggr account you can clone <a href="http://www.poggr.com/#/projects/project/peJE7qM0YUl">this pogg</a> and use its configuration tool to set up Facebook, S3, IAM, and DynamoDB and have your version of the game running in less than 5 minutes. If you don&rsquo;t have an account you can still check out the pogg&rsquo;s <a href="http://fooqri.poggr.com/peJE7qM0YUl:dxkgN7qMCtLg">README</a> to learn more about how it was build and view the source documents.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I promised a few examples of spreadsheet driven apps. You may remember the <a href="http://rwx.io/blog/2014/10/15/spreadsheet-driven-web-apps/">Hipster List</a> was the first example. These are simple web apps that are initialized using data from a Google Spreadsheet once the user loads them in a browser. Using spreadsheets to keep app information current is easy for anyone. There is even a way for users to point the app at their own Google Spreadsheet if the app developer wants to turn feature that on.</p>

<p>The next example of a spreadsheet driven app (<em>below</em>) is the <strong><em>Mobile Buyer&rsquo;s Agent</em></strong> app. This may take a little time to load because it is an experiment, and thus not using a vulcanized Polymer library, so it is importing lots of individual library documents. Be patient and once cached in your browser it will be fast.</p>

<p><a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pe16vKTbVLg::16" target="_blank"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/goddip-poggs/pe16vKTbVLg/screen1.png"  style="height: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a></p>

<p>The idea is to create a mobile web app that can be used by buyers as they shop for a home. Once again the data is maintained in a Google spreadsheet, this time by the buyer&rsquo;s agent. The agent can add houses, home information, and notes to the spreadsheet and the buyer can use the app to view the information as they shop. This is an easy way for an agent to personalize their client experience.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdEhuM1gxY1g0ckwwWl9RSzNGTGQwemc&amp;usp=sharing#gid=4">spreadsheet</a> to see how information is organized. It allows the agent to add personalized title and notes to each house.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://fooqri.poggr.com/pe16vKTbVLg:dgkE6vtp-4Ll::16">README</a> document provides  more details on how the app was built. Or <a href="https://fooqri.poggr.com/pe16vKTbVLg::16">try the app here</a>. I will likely provide a few updates to this app in the near future to make it a bit more interesting, but I though the first version showed a few nice features, and how to build them.</p>

As part of the activity I ported all of the  <a href="http://nvd3.org/examples/index.html" target="_blank">NVD3 example charts</a> to a web component I am calling <em>&lt;goddip-charts></em>. The component is contained in a <a href="http://www.poggr.com/pekqyTpXDEe:deJoY70GdVx" target="_blank">pogg</a> on <a href="http://www.poggr.com/home/" target="_blank">poggr.com</a>, as this is where I do my experimenting and it allows me to code and serve the project documents in the one place.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The above chart is an iframe to <a href="http://www.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlym9bhp4Lx::53" target="_blank">this document</a> The actual element tag used is as follows:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;goddip-charts  
   class="small-chart-styles"
   chartType="bar"
   context="/pg1GXbi9MBx:deyDCclAEUg::53" 
   css="/pg1GXbi9MBx:dxkNM7ZicfBe::53" &gt;
 &lt;/goddip-charts &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To view the uncompiled and unminified source see (<a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlym9bhp4Lx::49" target="_blank">html document source</a>, <a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:deyDCclAEUg::49" target="_blank">data document source</a>, and <a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dxkNM7ZicfBe::49" target="_blank">style document source</a>).</p>

<p>The best way to learn about the <em>&lt;goddip-charts></em> component is to take a look at its <a href="http://www.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dgJXG7boqzSe" target="_blank">README document</a>. This describes how to use each of the charts, reference data, add styling, etc. You can always view the component <a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlJkI7k9tBe" target="_blank">source</a>. If you have a <em>poggr.com</em> account you can view, clone, and edit <em>goddip-charts</em> using the <a href="http://project.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx" target="_blank">poggr project UI</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As an emacs/<a href="http://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">org-mode</a>/<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/" target="_blank">babel</a> user I have always been fascinated with the potential of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming" target="_blank">literate programming</a> and combining inline code in my notes. I have many org-mode documents that interactively execute code for various tasks and procedures. These tasks includes certain maintenance activities, or destructive operations I don&rsquo;t want to get wrong. I have an entire org document devoted to db maintenance, filled with Ruby code to execute complicated db queries and operations.  It is nice to see the example code inline in my notes, and be able to modify the code and execute it directly in my notes. This works especially well for checklist where calculations or actions are called for. You might even say org-mode was one inspiration for building <em><a href="http://www.poggr.com/home" target="_blank">poggr.com</a></em>; creating a browser based tool that is simple, flexible, and powerful for creating interactive and compelling documents that work in any web browser.</p>

<p>The potential of browser-based literate programming is why I find the idea of <em>Literate CoffeeScript</em> facinating. It is not just the idea of documenting code or even the idea of describing code in a blog post. It is the idea of creating flexible and effective browser based <em>task</em> and <em>tool</em> documents. The power in these types of documents is you see the code you are executing, which is extremely useful for programmer&rsquo;s notes. It seems literate CoffeeScript might have something to say about how to create browser-based interactive notes that include inline code, like emacs/org-mode/babel has done for emacs users.</p>

<p>Since <em><a href="http://www.poggr.com/home" target="_blank">poggr.com</a></em> supports compiling CoffeeScript into JavaScript  I decided to turn on literate CoffeeScript and give it a go to see if this is a legitimate way to combine code and blogging in a single pogg document.</p>

<h3>Poggr CoffeeScript Compilation</h3>

<p>The way poggr works is that when you save a <em>CoffeeScript</em> document <em>poggr</em> keeps both source code and compiled <em>JavaScript</em> code. Just like when you save a <em>markdown</em> document poggr saves both the source markdown and the compiled html. When a document is requested using a <em>poggid</em> in an http request, poggr will deliver the compiled code unless a query parameter is used to request source. This works out quite well in most cases, since the compiled version is what browsers are expecting (html, css, JavaScript). This model allows poggr to support other markup and languages like <em>less</em>, <em>scss</em>, <em>yaml</em>, etc to work similarly.</p>

<p><em>LitCoffeeScript</em> is unique in that compilation produces two documents (markdown &ndash;> html) and (CoffeeScript &ndash;> JavaScript). Thus, one challenge is knowing whether a document request is for the  html or JavaScript version. I felt compelled enough to experiment that I added a test case where adding a <strong>.js</strong> extention to a <em>poggid</em> will return the JavaScript, otherwise it will return the compiled html version of the document.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script src="//www.poggr.com/peJo73gk0Nx:dxkfEl2RANx.js"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I wanted to pick something fun to experiment with so I chose a game originally created by <em><a href="https://gist.github.com/macournoyer">Marc-AndrÃ© Cournoyer</a></em>.
in his <em><a href="https://gist.github.com/macournoyer/7357908" target="_blank">game.litcoffee</a></em> gist.</p>

<p>You can see my version of the  literate CoffeeScript post in action <a href="http://goddip.poggr.com/peJo73gk0Nx:dxkfEl2RANx" target="_blank">here</a>. What you will notice it the game is running as part of the post, and all the code is also embedded in the post. This may look like a normal code example post, but if you look at the  <a href="//source.poggr.com/peJo73gk0Nx:dxkfEl2RANx" target="_blank">source code</a> you will see at the end of the source document that the post actually loads the js version of itself. So by saving a literate CoffeeScript document you automatically get a blog post; in addition all of the fenced  CoffeeScript code is compiled into a JavaScript document.  Any changed inline code is re-compiled into an updated JavaScript document with each save. <strong><em>Mind Blown right!</em></strong></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t see it replacing my emacs/org/babel workflow yet, but it certainly opens some possibilities for having a set of private online notes, experiments, and tools I can call up in any browser to edit and execute. One down-side is while emacs is mode-less in that editing and execution happen together, the browser model is built for view-only. Poggr is built on browser-based document editing, but viewing the rendered results is still a separate action. Although it is not exactly the same emacs/org-mode, there are cases where it is actually better. Emacs does not excel where rich visualization and rendering are beneficial, this is what the browser does best.</p>

<p>When I get a chance I will port a few of my org-mode notes over to literate CoffeeScript documents on poggr and make a note here when they are up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dgyFhkQ9M8e"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/goddip-poggs/pgyUYTfcMUe/example_screen.png"></a></p>

<p>Using Google spreadsheets is a great way for a team to collaborate on a data set but it leaves a bit to be desired on presentation of the data. To that end I will be creating a series of fun examples showing how to build small interactive apps that utilize <em>Google Docs</em> and <em>Polymer</em> web components to quickly bring data to life. In this series I will be using a Google spreadsheet as the data source, but other data sources are possible, and I will get to those as well in future posts.</p>

<p>The first example is  <strong><em><a href="http://fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dgyFhkQ9M8e">Hipster List</a></em></strong>, an app that shows cool places to visit in various cities. Check out the <strong><em><a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">README</a></em></strong> document for details on how this app is put together.</p>

<p><a href="//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdHRaTlI3Y2EydllTa2NsRjlxRVhMRlE&usp=sharing#gid=0"><img class="spreadsheet-screen" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/goddip-poggs/pgyUYTfcMUe/spreadsheet_screen.png"></a></p>

<p>A little convention is used to make it work. Namely, I use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdHRaTlI3Y2EydllTa2NsRjlxRVhMRlE&amp;usp=sharing">Hipster Hot Spots</a> Google spreadsheet, where each city&rsquo;s data is represented by a tab in the spreadsheet. There is also a <em>key</em> tab that provides a list of all the cities in the spreadsheet and the tab id (<em>gid</em>) for each city&rsquo;s data. The app will load its data from the spreadsheet and populate the city drop-down list of <em>hot spots</em>, and display a map with markers for each <em>hot spot</em>. This was a fun first example, remember to checkout the <a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">readme document</a> for code and explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I enabled url fragment parameters so you can easily point the app at your own copy of the spreadsheet for testing. See the <a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">readme document</a> for the how-to instructions. Feel free to copy the spreadsheet and try out the app with your own list of cities and <em>hot spots</em>.</p>

<p> Separating code and data is always beneficial, but there is something cool about connecting an app to a Google spreadsheet. There are many spreadsheet users who would like to have an app to visualize their data, but may not be up to the coding challenge yet. I think many small useful apps could be built this way;  I will pick a few to build in the next few weeks and discuss them here. I am using the <em><a href="//www.poggr.com/home">poggr.com</a></em> service for the example, which is a service I built just for these types of small quick apps that can rely on an external data service. It is basically working to merge interactive content creation and blogging into a single service.</p>

<p> Leave me a comment if you have an small spreadsheet driven app you would like me to build. If it seems reasonable I may add it to the list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is sometimes handy to turn on CoreData.SQLDebug in the simulator when debugging a Core Data issue. I have found the output to be very useful in finding the hard to find little bugs that pop-up between restkit and core data. It can also help find performance issues with the database.  Unfortunately there isn&rsquo;t any documentation for how to do this in RubyMotion. I found one solution that works to a degree. It requires installing the ios_sim app and forcing the simulator into CoreData.SQLDebug mode after the rubymotion build.</p>

<p>You will need to install ios_sim</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install ios-sim
</code></pre>

<p>Then add the following two line as the last lines in your RubyMotion rakefile</p>

<pre><code># Be sure to substitute your app name and make sure you are using
# the correct path to the app based on simulator version.
ios_sim = `which ios-sim`.strip
sh "#{ios_sim} launch build/iPhoneSimulator-6.1-Development/appname.app --args -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1"
</code></pre>

<p>This will open the simulator in CoreData.SQLDebug mode, and log debug information to the terminal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note, I was getting an undefined constant error for
RKLogConfigureByName, the standard way of setting up logging in
RestKit. It seems that the #define statements in the
<em>/vendor/Pods/RestKit/Code/Support/RKLog.h</em> file are not getting
picked up. I am using the pod and loading with RubyMotion pod support,
so IÃ¥m not sure what the issue is. I will need to investigate further
but this quick workaround works, just call the lower-level method
mapped via the #define. For example instead of RKLogConfigureByName
use RKlcl_configure_by_name.  I also list all the RKlcl_v constants to
use instead of the RKLogLevel constants. I also included an example of
how they are used, in this case I have put the setup in a method, and
it gets called from the the standard didFinishLaunchingWithOption
application block.</p>
