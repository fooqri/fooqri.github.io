  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to make a quick note that I have been using <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a> the past few months. I don&rsquo;t mind building natively in Objective-C but since I have been coding both the app and the server side I found switching between Objective-C and Ruby a bit frustrating. I really find Objective-C to be too verbose a syntax for my taste. I also prefer to code in emacs vs. the Xcode UI. Call me old fashioned, but I find I can work much faster when I can operate on the code directly, versus through an intermediary UI.</p>

<p>The second reason for switching to RubyMotion is the libraries that are being created, they make iOS development feel so comfortable to a Ruby developer. Three key examples are <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/BubbleWrap">BubbleWrap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/sugarcube">SugarcCube</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/teacup">Teacup</a>.</p>

<p>The third reason is testing and debugging, I like that RubyMotion comes with an RSpec clone, this means I have the same testing framework on both app and server. I also love the interactive console, there is nothing like tweaking your app live from a console (REPL). I find I can debug a lot of the code from the console, but RubyMotion also supports GDB for the more serious debugging needs. I hadn&rsquo;t used GDB in a few years but it came back to me pretty quickly once I started using it.</p>

<p>I also like the DSL approach of Teacup in styling RubyMotion iOS apps. I like that I can create style files much like I do with CSS and have my app UI built with the style information, makes changing style feel more natural to me as a web developer.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that there are many Objective-C developers who are extremely efficient in building apps, but it is always a challenge to become expert on multiple platforms. To become an expert iOS developer you need to become expert in the Cocoa libraries; the nice thing about RubyMotion is it allows you to learn the libraries within a familiar syntax if you are a ruby developer. It also allows you to create Ruby wrappers and generators that make developing for Cocoa feel more natural to a Ruby developer. Finally, since RubyMotion creates compiled native iOS apps, their is very little performance hit.</p>

<p>I have a backlog of notes that I will post when I get a chance; including my experiences with development,  debugging, meta-programming, deploying via TestFlight, etc. I just wanted to give RubyMotion some praise from this Ruby developer, it has made developing iOS apps very similar to deploying ruby apps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We have recently been working on an iOS app that requires a backend service. In this case I was looking for something leaner, simpler, and faster than Rails since it was only an API for a mobile app, no web front-end. I wanted it to be very lean and scalable so we could make it through early user testing without spending a lot on servers. Ok, ideally without spending anything on servers; basically how much could I squeeze out of one Heroku worker.</p>

<p>After some investigation of the typical light weight ruby frameworks (Sinatra, Merb, etc) I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, a ruby API micro-framework. Grape uses a very simple DSL for defining APIs for your Ruby objects. Grape runs on <a href="https://github.com/postrank-labs/goliath">Goliath</a>, which is a non-blocking Ruby web server framework that uses Ruby fibers to simplify the handling of asynchronous requests. Goliath runs on the popular <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine</a> reactor. EventMachine is an event-driven Ruby library that works much like Node.js.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> github page provides a great deal of information on getting started, and David Jones has a great <a href="https://github.com/djones/grape-goliath-example">example</a> project on GitHub demonstrating how to deploy a grape API on Heroku.</p>

<p>The DSL is really simple and I was able to wrap some ruby objects in a day and deploy it on Heroku. Here is an snippet of what the DSL looks like.</p>

<div class="gist">https://gist.github.com/4555788</div>


<p>As you can see the Grape framework supports API versioning, and the DSL provides a simple way to define API endpoints by defining resources and then specifying the HTTP requests (get, post, put, delete) for that resource. Any Rails developer should feel comfortable with the paths, params, and routes syntax in Grape.</p>

<p>In this code snippet I show part of the API definition for two resources (missions &amp; players). This will mean the path for accessing these are <em>/missions</em> and <em>/players</em>. Because I specified <em>prefix &lsquo;api&rsquo;</em> at the top of the file, the actual path becomes <em>/api/missions</em> and <em>/api/players</em>. So for example the <em>get &ldquo;/:id&rdquo;</em> would correspond to a get request of /api/players/7E781305-777F-4044-9770-C7995585F540 where the UUID is a player id and would be available in the params[:id] variable.</p>

<p>I should also note that even though these are simple <em>get</em> requests Grape will expect a header to be set for the secret key(secretk), and also require an Accept header with the version, vendor info, and content type (json). The easiest way to test your API will be to use an app like <a href="http://goo.gl/daZ5Q">Postman</a> that makes it easy to formulating requests, setting headers, from your Chrome browser. Postman also allows you to save requests, and re-run them.</p>

<p>I happen to be using Mongo for this, but Grape supports most major DBs. I am only showing two get methods, my full definition supports CRUD for these objects, as well as a few common queries of the db. The error checking of the request is fairly straightforward. I am checking for an API key, but this would be replaced with an API key lookup function to validate the requestor. It is easy to respond with specific errors as you can see.</p>

<p>The terse <em>error!, unless</em> syntax makes the error handling code very readable. The request handling for these two examples are simple: I query a mongo collection for an id, then map that response onto objects, and then convert the objects to json. This looks funny since it is basically json-&gt;object-&gt;json since mongo returns json, but there is more that happens in the object mapping; the json from the db and the json from the object are not the same.</p>

<p>By requiring <em>mission.rb</em> and <em>player.rb</em> at the top of the file, I pull in my Mission and Player classes so they can be used in the map operation.   Try to ignore the lame <em>.first</em> operation, this was a bit of laziness in dealing with what is an array of one item resulting from the map operation. As with all Ruby, the output of the last operation is what is returned in the body of the response.</p>

<p>The DSL is very clean and makes API maintenance relatively easy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been investigating using the ruby <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem for a project. State machines can be very handy in simplifying code where objects move through various states. The <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem embeds state machine behavior into any class that uses it. My first test was to create a simple todo list example.  The todo list will include a main list that contains items and sublists.  This allows a way to organize items easily into sublists.</p>

<p>A simple way to do this is to declare two classes <em>List</em> and <em>Item</em> and allow an object of class <em>List</em> to contain a list of <em>Lists</em> and a list of <em>Items</em>. This approach allows a flat list with many items, or a hierarchical list with top-level items, but also sub-lists that contain their own items.</p>

<p>In addition to lists and items, I want is to track whether I have completed all of the items in a list. In the case of a hierarchical list this means all items of sub-lists as well. Thus in addition to lists and items, we need to track whether items and lists are in progress or completed.</p>

<p>The next step is deciding on the states of the two object types. For my example, I decided:
* a list will have an initial state of <em>available</em>, and will transition to state <em>started</em> when the first item on the list is completed. When all items and sublists are <em>completed</em> the list will move to the state <em>completed</em>.
* an item will have an initial state of <em>available</em> and will transition to <em>completed</em> when the item is finished.</p>

<p>Finally I want to inform the user when:
* an item is completed
* a list is completed
* the project is completed (all items and sublists are completed)</p>

<p>Here is a quick example of the code to meet these requirements:</p>

<div class="gist">https://gist.github.com/4549146</div>


<p>As you can see there is a rich environment for embedding behavior, including adding it in the <em>state</em> definitions, adding it using the <em>before_transition</em> method, and adding it using the <em>after_transition</em> method. You can also define methods inside the state definition so you can extend the functionality of a state.</p>

<p>Now if you load this example in IRB you can play with the lists and items like so:</p>

<pre><code> load "list_example.rb"
 list = List.new("Groceries", "Get some groceries")
 wf = list.add_list("Whole Foods", "Get some groceries from Whole Foods")
 milk = list.add_item("Milk", "2% Milk")
 strawberries = wf.add_item("Strawberries", "Ripe organic Strawberries"))
 oranges = wf.add_item("Oranges", "Ripe mandarine oranges")

 strawberries.finish 
 =&amp;gt; finished item Strawberries

 oranges.finish  
 =&amp;gt; finished item Oranges
 =&amp;gt; congrats on completing list Whole Foods

 milk.finish
 =&amp;gt; finished item Milk
 =&amp;gt; congrats on completing project Groceries
</code></pre>

<p>This was a really simple example, but shows how easy it is to create classes that embed state machines. For more check out the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem.</p>

<h3>State Diagrams</h3>

<p>The library also allows you to generate graphs of the states and transitions in each class. For example:</p>

<p>create a Rakefile.rb</p>

<pre><code> require 'tasks/state_machine'
 require './list_example.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Then in terminal execute:</p>

<pre><code> rake state_machine:draw CLASS=List 
</code></pre>

<p>For the <em>List</em> class shown above this will generate a png file named <em>List_list_state.png</em> that looks like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d78e332b4656b62dec36c2a2d2408a82/tumblr_inline_mgqav0Q8uW1qz562v.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <em>List</em> class is very simple so the diagram is also simple. In the case of my project there are many states and more complicated transitions between states so the diagram can be very handy to visualize what is happening when  debugging a strange transition,</p>

<h3>Wrapup</h3>

<p>This todo list example is very simple but it allows exploring the basic features of the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem, and demonstrates how simple it is to add state machine functionality to classes.  If a class you are designing has variables that keep state, and you are triggering behaviors when those variables change, then a state machine will likely be a more clean approach to organizing behavior in your class.</p>
