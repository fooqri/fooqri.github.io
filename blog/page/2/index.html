  <div class="entry-content"><p>We have recently been working on an iOS app that requires a backend service. In this case I was looking for something leaner, simpler, and faster than Rails since it was only an API for a mobile app, no web front-end. I wanted it to be very lean and scalable so we could make it through early user testing without spending a lot on servers. Ok, ideally without spending anything on servers; basically how much could I squeeze out of one Heroku worker.</p>

<p>After some investigation of the typical light weight ruby frameworks (Sinatra, Merb, etc) I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a>, a ruby API micro-framework. Grape uses a very simple DSL for defining APIs for your Ruby objects. Grape runs on <a href="https://github.com/postrank-labs/goliath">Goliath</a>, which is a non-blocking Ruby web server framework that uses Ruby fibers to simplify the handling of asynchronous requests. Goliath runs on the popular <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine</a> reactor. EventMachine is an event-driven Ruby library that works much like Node.js.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> github page provides a great deal of information on getting started, and David Jones has a great <a href="https://github.com/djones/grape-goliath-example">example</a> project on GitHub demonstrating how to deploy a grape API on Heroku.</p>

<p>The DSL is really simple and I was able to wrap some ruby objects in a day and deploy it on Heroku. Here is an snippet of what the DSL looks like.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4555788.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>As you can see the Grape framework supports API versioning, and the DSL provides a simple way to define API endpoints by defining resources and then specifying the HTTP requests (get, post, put, delete) for that resource. Any Rails developer should feel comfortable with the paths, params, and routes syntax in Grape.</p>

<p>In this code snippet I show part of the API definition for two resources (missions &amp; players). This will mean the path for accessing these are <em>/missions</em> and <em>/players</em>. Because I specified <em>prefix &lsquo;api&rsquo;</em> at the top of the file, the actual path becomes <em>/api/missions</em> and <em>/api/players</em>. So for example the <em>get &ldquo;/:id&rdquo;</em> would correspond to a get request of /api/players/7E781305-777F-4044-9770-C7995585F540 where the UUID is a player id and would be available in the params[:id] variable.</p>

<p>I should also note that even though these are simple <em>get</em> requests Grape will expect a header to be set for the secret key(secretk), and also require an Accept header with the version, vendor info, and content type (json). The easiest way to test your API will be to use an app like <a href="http://goo.gl/daZ5Q">Postman</a> that makes it easy to formulating requests, setting headers, from your Chrome browser. Postman also allows you to save requests, and re-run them.</p>

<p>I happen to be using Mongo for this, but Grape supports most major DBs. I am only showing two get methods, my full definition supports CRUD for these objects, as well as a few common queries of the db. The error checking of the request is fairly straightforward. I am checking for an API key, but this would be replaced with an API key lookup function to validate the requestor. It is easy to respond with specific errors as you can see.</p>

<p>The terse <em>error!, unless</em> syntax makes the error handling code very readable. The request handling for these two examples are simple: I query a mongo collection for an id, then map that response onto objects, and then convert the objects to json. This looks funny since it is basically json-&gt;object-&gt;json since mongo returns json, but there is more that happens in the object mapping; the json from the db and the json from the object are not the same.</p>

<p>By requiring <em>mission.rb</em> and <em>player.rb</em> at the top of the file, I pull in my Mission and Player classes so they can be used in the map operation.   Try to ignore the lame <em>.first</em> operation, this was a bit of laziness in dealing with what is an array of one item resulting from the map operation. As with all Ruby, the output of the last operation is what is returned in the body of the response.</p>

<p>The DSL is very clean and makes API maintenance relatively easy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been investigating using the ruby <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem for a project. State machines can be very handy in simplifying code where objects move through various states. The <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem embeds state machine behavior into any class that uses it. My first test was to create a simple todo list example.  The todo list will include a main list that contains items and sublists.  This allows a way to organize items easily into sublists.</p>

<p>A simple way to do this is to declare two classes <em>List</em> and <em>Item</em> and allow an object of class <em>List</em> to contain a list of <em>Lists</em> and a list of <em>Items</em>. This approach allows a flat list with many items, or a hierarchical list with top-level items, but also sub-lists that contain their own items.</p>

<p>In addition to lists and items, I want is to track whether I have completed all of the items in a list. In the case of a hierarchical list this means all items of sub-lists as well. Thus in addition to lists and items, we need to track whether items and lists are in progress or completed.</p>

<p>The next step is deciding on the states of the two object types. For my example, I decided:
* a list will have an initial state of <em>available</em>, and will transition to state <em>started</em> when the first item on the list is completed. When all items and sublists are <em>completed</em> the list will move to the state <em>completed</em>.
* an item will have an initial state of <em>available</em> and will transition to <em>completed</em> when the item is finished.</p>

<p>Finally I want to inform the user when:
* an item is completed
* a list is completed
* the project is completed (all items and sublists are completed)</p>

<p>Here is a quick example of the code to meet these requirements:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4549146.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>As you can see there is a rich environment for embedding behavior, including adding it in the <em>state</em> definitions, adding it using the <em>before_transition</em> method, and adding it using the <em>after_transition</em> method. You can also define methods inside the state definition so you can extend the functionality of a state.</p>

<p>Now if you load this example in IRB you can play with the lists and items like so:</p>

<pre><code> load "list_example.rb"
 list = List.new("Groceries", "Get some groceries")
 wf = list.add_list("Whole Foods", "Get some groceries from Whole Foods")
 milk = list.add_item("Milk", "2% Milk")
 strawberries = wf.add_item("Strawberries", "Ripe organic Strawberries"))
 oranges = wf.add_item("Oranges", "Ripe mandarine oranges")

 strawberries.finish 
 =&amp;gt; finished item Strawberries

 oranges.finish  
 =&amp;gt; finished item Oranges
 =&amp;gt; congrats on completing list Whole Foods

 milk.finish
 =&amp;gt; finished item Milk
 =&amp;gt; congrats on completing project Groceries
</code></pre>

<p>This was a really simple example, but shows how easy it is to create classes that embed state machines. For more check out the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem.</p>

<h3>State Diagrams</h3>

<p>The library also allows you to generate graphs of the states and transitions in each class. For example:</p>

<p>create a Rakefile.rb</p>

<pre><code> require 'tasks/state_machine'
 require './list_example.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Then in terminal execute:</p>

<pre><code> rake state_machine:draw CLASS=List 
</code></pre>

<p>For the <em>List</em> class shown above this will generate a png file named <em>List_list_state.png</em> that looks like the image below.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d78e332b4656b62dec36c2a2d2408a82/tumblr_inline_mgqav0Q8uW1qz562v.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <em>List</em> class is very simple so the diagram is also simple. In the case of my project there are many states and more complicated transitions between states so the diagram can be very handy to visualize what is happening when  debugging a strange transition,</p>

<h3>Wrapup</h3>

<p>This todo list example is very simple but it allows exploring the basic features of the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine">state_machine</a> gem, and demonstrates how simple it is to add state machine functionality to classes.  If a class you are designing has variables that keep state, and you are triggering behaviors when those variables change, then a state machine will likely be a more clean approach to organizing behavior in your class.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is often a tension between product management and engineering when it comes to time spent adding new features vs. time spent in code refactoring.  One could even explain this in terms of top line vs bottom line descriptions. Features mean sales, codebase is an asset, and poor code quality is a liability that affects cost and thus profit. Sloppy, risky, or fragile code is even called &ldquo;technical debt&rdquo; in many circles. This tension between features and code quality has always been a tightrope walk for any successful software or Internet company. Starve features and you kill sales, ignore expanding bloat and you will never win a sprint, let alone the marathon of staying relevant.</p>

<p>But there is a lot more to refactoring than code quality. In this post I wanted to mention one that is often overlooked: <em>&ldquo;refactoring makes good coders into master coders.&rdquo;</em>  The best lessons come from revisiting your mistakes and improving them, but without refactoring the revisiting is limited to quick fixes to limit the impact of a bad architecture, design, or implementation. Yes we can learn from our mistakes by trying different approaches on future projects, but the problems are ever changing, and thus the learnings are not as clear. I have always found I learned so much more as a designer and a developer by revisiting a problem with a new level of experience to draw from.</p>

<p>Design has been more fortunate regarding the opportunity for refactoring; good design organizations understand how much can be learned by refactoring a design and thus fight hard to allow for it. Development has often not been as successful in making the case. I wonder if the cost analysis could be changed if executives understood that refactoring actually significantly improved two of the most important assets at a software company: the code base and the engineering talent. Then it becomes a more interesting decision versus a simple weighing of new features vs improved quality.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/7095223771e3c38939367f18458726e1/tumblr_inline_mgmwbwyolq1qz562v.jpg" alt="image" />Bull</p>

<p>I got to thinking about this looking at Picasso&rsquo;s Bull series.  This is an excellent example of a master working through a problem to develop the most elegantly simplified expression of the subject. To become a master, one must work through a problem incrementally and always looking for elegant ways to improve, to simplify the end expression of the solution. Even for a competent coder, it is not always apparent what is elegant without seeing the real life consequences of chosen approaches. Whether the approach makes the code fragile, bloated, or unfriendly, it is only through the experience of trying to grow a code base that these issues can be truly understood. Under the right conditions refactoring provides a sort of express lane  to becoming a master developer. This is very difficult if you are never allowed to truly revisit a subject after completing the first expression of the solution. I like the &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; example because it is how I think of elegant design and development, just enough to represent the solution and no more, anything else is bloat that will be nothing but cost later. Through refactoring, a developer can develop insights, skills, and techniques more quickly by addressing a well understood problem from a more experienced perspective.  Practice make perfect. If not the code, maybe the coder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my home office I have a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad. When I use my MacBook Air elsewhere in the house I constantly see connect and disconnect messages for these devices. Frequently toggling BT on/off can be a pain; the menu bar method for toggling BT requires scanning the menu bar for the BT glyph, clicking on it, finding the correct menu item and clicking on it. All that scanning, tracking, and clicking can be disruptive to a good mental flow; I wanted a quick keyboard shortcut to toggle bluetoooth on/off. I use <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and after a quick search I found <a href="http://seapy.com/1779">this</a> extension that does just that. I use “bt” as the shortcut code.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a logophile, and regularly looking up the meanings of words I encounter on the web or in pdf documents. More recent OS X versions include a great feature that allows you to get a quick definition in almost any app (browser, editor, etc). Highlight a word and press <em>ctrl-command-d</em> to get the definition of the word. It is easy to configure to include Wikipedia definitions so you can also look up people and concepts.</p>

<p>To customize which dictionaries are used (including wikipedia entries) open spotlight (command-space), type dictionary and press return to open the dictionary app. Open the preferences menu and tick the checkbox for the sources you wish to use. Once you make pressing <em>ctrl-command-d</em> a habit you will find using it is very natural, and requires little thought to remember it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have wikipedia configured and then try it on these:</p>

<ul>
<li>crepuscule</li>
<li>quiescent</li>
<li>Malta</li>
<li>Thomas Bayes</li>
<li>Markov chain</li>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2013-01-01T11:04:00-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 1<span>st</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past year I have had the opportunity to advise a number of people I have worked with in the past who are starting companies. In the past few years my role had been that of a director of both design and R&amp;D teams and so I enjoy continuing that type of role in providing direction to these exciting new startup ventures.</p>

<p>One thing  many of these early phase projects lack is clarity and proper measurement of the problem and opportunity; having only a vague sense of their relative probability of success given their chosen direction versus alternative approaches.</p>

<p>Lately a lot of new startups tend to point to some fuzzy “user experience” as their advantage, and why they will succeed. As a design director I know that this is B.S. and even design and user experience contributions can be measured to a reasonable degree of confidence.</p>

<p>More times than I care to say, I have pointed teams to read and practice the techniques in <em>&ldquo;How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business&rdquo;</em> by Douglas Hubbard.</p>

<p>The first response is always, “Read a book, are you serious” — yes I am serious, this is a good book and for many people it provides some very important tools for success around estimation and prediction. If you learn and use this on your project it will become automatic for you, and require little thought. It just takes practice.</p>

<p>Here are just a few key excerpts to motivate you to read it:</p>

<p><em>There are three reasons why people think things can’t be measured, all are misconceptions about different aspects of measurement: Concept, Object, and Method.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Concept of Measurement. The definition of measurement itself is widely misunderstood. If one understands what measurement means, a lot more things become possible.</li>
<li>Object of measurement. The thing being measured is not well defined. Sloppy and ambiguous language gets in the way of measurement.</li>
<li>Methods of measurement. Many procedures of empirical observation are not well known. If people were familiar with some of the basic methods, it would become apparent that many things thought to be immeasurable are not only measurable but may already have been measured.</li>
</ol>


<p>Hubbard does a good job of making it clear that these three misconceptions are easily overcome, and you can learn to measure anything quickly. More importantly perhaps, you will end up with a better defined question or problem through the process of identifying measures.</p>

<p>He uses a definition of measurement based on uncertainty  that is very powerful, echoing Shannon’s information theory of entropy:</p>

<blockquote><p>Measurement is a quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations.</p></blockquote>

<p>By framing measurement as “uncertainty reduction,” Hubbard has solved the problem for many people who get stuck thinking of measurement as an impossibly exact science. For as Hubbard points out, even inexact measurement is valuable if it reduces uncertainty by some non-trivial amount. This is especially true when investment in the project is high.</p>

<p>He spends several chapters on techniques for determining what to measure and how, and then get’s into what I found to be a great exercise for teams.  It involves calibration of estimation for team members. By evaluating how calibrated people are at estimation (usually not!) we can get the team to understand they they need to improve, and more importantly with the right tools they can learn to be quite proficient at estimation. Having this skill will help them in many ways in their day-to-day work.</p>

<p>Hubbard  discusses the terrible misunderstanding and misuse of risk management in business and R&amp;D projects. <em>You know, those useless Low/Med/High values people put on their slides!</em> He instead prescribes the use of basic confidence intervals and shows the reader how to use them.</p>

<p><strong>A simple example is his test of confidence.</strong></p>

<p>For a given question you provide a range you believe has a 90% CI. For example you say with 90% confidence the module will take you 2-3 days to code, unit test, and submit to system test. Or the wireframe will take you 3-6 hours to update, get reviewed, and hand to engineering.</p>

<p>Then ask yourself this: Suppose I offered you a chance to win $1000 in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>You win $1,000 if you your estimation turns out to be correct. If not, you win nothing.</li>
<li>You spin a dial divided into two unequal “pie slices,” one comprising 90% of the dial and the other just 10%. If the dial lands on the large slice, you win $1,000. If it lands on the small slice, you win nothing (i.e., there is a 90% chance you win $1,000).</li>
</ol>


<p>About 80% of people choose option 2, but why would this be if their estimate is of 90% CI or higher. In reality they probably are more like 50%-80% confident. For those who choose option 1, it could also mean they are over 90% confidence but being conservative in estimating, this can be equally undesirable.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>Equivalent Bet Test</strong>. You should try to set up a mental test like this when assessing confidence and if you pick the wheel then keep lowering the win percentage on the wheel (80%, 70%, 60%, …) until you don’t pick the wheel, that will tell you your real confidence in the answer. Research shows turning it into a bet (real or pretend) increases the quality of the estimates.</p>

<p>People who are very good at assessing their uncertainty (i.e. they are right 80% of the time they say they are 80% confident, etc.) are called calibrated. <em>It is good to be calibrated, projects and life become more predictable.</em></p>

<p>This was just a short teaser of a simple technique, but there are more techniques. I highly recommend Hubbard’s book for anyone involved in complex  endeavors whether on their own or in teams. You will find problems are more clearly articulated once you have  figured out how to measure it; having good calibration in estimation will also significantly reduce your project risk and improve your decision making significantly.</p>

<p>There was a recent question on Quora: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Engineering-Management/Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3">Why are software development task estimations regularly off by a factor of 2-3?</a> That I believe is true because of teams not doing proper analysis, but also it is a multiplier effect of bad estimation across a team. Because of interdependencies of teams these estimation errors can cause huge estimation errors when rolled together.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using Omnigraffle to create activity diagrams associated with user stories. Some people may find this overkill but I find doing these diagrams makes transitions clear that might otherwise be missed until later when they lead to costly re-architecting of the screens and flows.</p>

<p>I use Omnigraffle for UI wireframes, so it seemed natural to use it for activity diagrams, which is what I have been doing.  The issue is keeping the diagrams up to date.  Today, while playing with the <a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/">Ragel</a> state machine compiler I discovered Ragel&rsquo;s awesome states/transitions diagramming feature. I learned the feature uses <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> to create the diagrams from the parser grammar.  This led me to <a href="https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz/">Ruby Graphviz</a>, a Ruby library for interacting with Graphviz. It got me thinking that maybe there was a simple DSL that could be used to describe UI activities and screens and then automatically generate diagrams from the description. This would make keeping descriptions and diagrams in sync very easy.</p>

<p>My first step is always to get a piece of the most basic idea working, then add another piece, etc until a basic prototype is complete. Given this approach the first step was to use ruby-graphviz to create a basic diagram similar to one of our activity diagrams (a very basic one). So here was a quick pass experiment for using ruby-graphvis to create a diagram. The next step would be to define a basic DSL and then write a parser and state-machine and incorporate the graph creation into the state machine as it parses the DSL activity description.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4431708.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This above very simple example creates the diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/61f780009a654f9724bcd4a9c703d9b4/tumblr_inline_mfz8syDgFP1qz562v.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This needs some cleanup of the aesthetics but the possibility is interesting. The next steps will be to come up with a very simple dsl, as simple as possible, maybe something that is markdown compliant so it fits inside our wiki pages cleanly. It would need to cover start and end states as well as intermediate state nodes. It would need to also handle decision points (diamonds) as well as transitions (edges) and notes. The simplest form would be to allow listing all nodes and all decisions, and then listing the connections between them. Labels would also be needed on all of these. IDs would probably help for wiring up the connections.</p>

<p>Then it is a matter of running a parser on the wiki pages, looking for the syntax associated with the activity descriptions and generating a diagram using some ruby code. This might be a nice experiment to familiarize myself with Ragel to better understand its strengths and capabilities.</p>

<p>I hope to get to spend some free time on this over the coming weeks, as it seems like a fun side project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had my caps lock key mapped to the control key for the last few months as I have migrated back to Emacs from TextMate. It was a slight improvement over the placement of the control key but not a huge improvement. I came across this article: <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/a-useful-caps-lock-key/">A Useful CAPS-Lock Key</a> from Brett Terpstra and decided to give his mapping a try. This mapping requires free third party software, but I was particularly intrigued not by the escape key mapping, which is very handy, but by the &ldquo;Hyper-key&rdquo; (ctrl-shift-cmd-opt) being mapped to holding down the shift key. This opens a lot of potential system wide shortcut key-bindings that are a lot easier than using the uncomfortable ctrl-shift-cmd-opt.</p>

<p>So far it is very useful, I like the hyper-t for opening iTerm2 in visor mode, very handy. I will check back in in a month on this topic and share any other key bindings I come up with.</p>
