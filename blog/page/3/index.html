  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had my caps lock key mapped to the control key for the last few months as I have migrated back to Emacs from TextMate. It was a slight improvement over the placement of the control key but not a huge improvement. I came across this article: <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/a-useful-caps-lock-key/">A Useful CAPS-Lock Key</a> from Brett Terpstra and decided to give his mapping a try. This mapping requires free third party software, but I was particularly intrigued not by the escape key mapping, which is very handy, but by the &ldquo;Hyper-key&rdquo; (ctrl-shift-cmd-opt) being mapped to holding down the shift key. This opens a lot of potential system wide shortcut key-bindings that are a lot easier than using the uncomfortable ctrl-shift-cmd-opt.</p>

<p>So far it is very useful, I like the hyper-t for opening iTerm2 in visor mode, very handy. I will check back in in a month on this topic and share any other key bindings I come up with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the holiday I had some time to investigate parsing expression grammers. I had done work in Lex and Yacc many years back when I was responsible for some kernel functionality and related system management kernel commands for a proprietary commercial operating system. I don&rsquo;t remember fondly my time working with Yacc. But then I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">PEGs</a> and the <a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">Treetop</a> Ruby library. It allows the use of simple grammer rules based in regular expressions and creates a parser ruby class from the grammer that can then be used in a ruby program. It also allows ruby blocks to be embedded directly into the grammer rules.</p>

<p>For our startup we have a core feature that includes some user generated instructions that are meant to create a mobile experience for others to participate in, sort of a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">FSM</a> driven experience. We could present the authoring environment in  a form-based interface, but this seemed a bit too restrictive. We may still go with forms, but I wanted to try an intermediate format using user readable text files, so we could write up test cases fast and easy, and compile them into the FSM class. I was also inspired by the simplicity of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> syntax and the way it is used in <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a>. It may not pan out but I really had fun working on it.</p>

<p>I will post some code in the future, but thought I would post a link to the <a href="http://www.trsolutions.biz/blog/2010/03/10/treetop-introductory-tutorial-1-of-10/">tutorial</a> I found very helpful in getting my experiment up and running quickly. It is a well written tutorial that starts with the basics of getting a simple parser working, and then explores just enough complexity to get you to a place where a moderately complex grammer can be written. I think this is a great tool for any Ruby developer&rsquo;s tool belt; and for certain classes of problems related to parsing information it is a very eloquent approach.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using the <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a> app for  a couple of weeks. It is a very interesting app targeting writers, something I am not, but I was intrigued by the  interactivity of this minimalist app. Specifically the ability to add interactive todo lists and timers and have them execute in a text document. Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/#watchmovie">FoldingText Video</a> to get a feel for it, I don&rsquo;t want to describe ideas that a video shows so clearly.</p>

<p>I have been using it for my daily plan the past 2 weeks. I usually start each day with a mix of items I want to accomplish. These items usually include a mix of coding items for a sprint, some user stories for the backlog, and some wireframes for a future sprint, etc.  The mix keeps the day feeling balanced. I add a mix of these to the day&rsquo;s plan, and then organize them into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro</a> time slices.</p>

<p>The app&rsquo;s simplicity allows some really interesting customization that isn&rsquo;t present in an app like Vitamin-R, which is a good pomodoro app, but like most apps is not very flexible. For example, I have found that keeping the daily plan, now and later notes, and the time slices all in a single document is very powerful. Further I can add notes indented under time slices to describe what I did during each slice. Since everything is in a single text document (markdown) and lives in my nvALT notes app, I can easily search and find my daily notes that include what I accomplished each day, etc. This is good for reviewing how well certain activities mix together, looking at my velocity over time, etc.</p>

<p>All of that is useful but the reason for my making this post is that I find the interaction model to be very interesting, basically a text document with very simple embedded mini-apps that are triggered by simple human-readable phrases that add functionality while the document is open and in use. With all output living in the text document. It gives hints of a feeing of empowerment that early spreadsheet apps like Lotus123 delivered. I can imagine all sorts of useful embedded mini-apps, the key will be maintaining the simplicity. Many apps used for productivity today are incredibly prescriptive, FoldingText feels like you are really in control and able to customize the document as a very simple app. Of course FoldingText itself is still more of an app than a platform, but I can imagine it as a platform with many developers adding these mini-apps. Todo lists and timers seem like a powerful start, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what comes next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For our startup I have been using github wiki to keep the product specs, design docs, user stories, etc organized and up-to-date. The nice thing about github is you can clone the wiki and work on it locally and push changes up to the server. See this <a href="https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki/Editing-Wiki-Locally" title="writeup" target="_blank">writeup</a> for more info. This is handy because you can then work on the wiki using markdown syntax in a regular text editor versus a web page editor.</p>

<p>The ease of this made me wonder if there was a way to do my normal note taking, code journalling, etc in markdown vs Evernote. I did some looking around and found <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/" title="nvAlt" target="_blank">nvALT</a>, which is a markdown based notebook that can save notes as flat .md files.</p>

<p>So as an experiment I cloned my personal notes wiki from github.  After configuring nvALT to use the cloned wiki directory as its directory I could immediately see and search all of my wiki files as nvALT note files. Also I could add new files and they would now become linkable as wiki files. So basically nvALT acts as a note taking system, but notes can be also linked together via a mmd link notation that is supported by the github wiki. You can install the <a href="https://github.com/github/gollum" title="Gollum">gollum</a> gem and interact with the wiki locally to test the wiki pages.</p>

<p>So I can now create, edit, search notes in markdown, but also link them, as well as view them as a wiki.</p>

<p>I will post again after a few weeks trying out the solution with more info on how it is working.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doing iOS design and development I find myself capturing images on the iPhone all the time to make notes on. These usually end up being added to my notes or to our project wiki (see <a href="http://fooqri.tumblr.com/post/38160399193/screen-capture-goodness" title="Screen Capture Goodness">Screen capture goodness</a> and  <a href="http://fooqri.tumblr.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes" title="Wiki + Searchable Notes">Wiki + Searchable Notes</a> for more on that).</p>

<p>To get the images from the phone to my Mac I was using Apple&rsquo;s Photo Stream feature but it took too long and sometime images just didn&rsquo;t show up on the Mac. So I went looking for a better solution and found the <a href="http://www.photosync-app.com/" title="PhotoSync">PhotoSynch </a>app in the app store. You install it on the iphone via the ios app store ($1.99), and on the Mac via the Mac app store (Free).</p>

<p>It can then be configured to synch all the images in your camera roll with the Mac over wifi. It has a quick transfer feature that allows it to transfer all images since the last sync to the Mac.</p>

<p>You start the transfer on the phone, and when it completes a Finder window will appear on the Mac so you can see the images. At this point I use script to move certain images into the right folders. The process is quick, simple, and works every time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>tl;wr</h3>

<p>Take the shell script from below and create a TextExpander snippet to save any image in your OS X clipboard to disk with a unique uuid.png name, and automatically create a markdown image link that is pasted in place in your editor.</p>

<h3>verbose</h3>

<p>When making notes on wireframes, screen designs, activity diagrams, etc, I have a particular workflow where I do a screen capture and want to link the result in my markdown notes or from our project wiki. The power of markdown text files is their portability, the challenge can be losing the rich cut and paste of apps like Evernote.</p>

<p>In a previous post <a href="http://fooqri.tumblr.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes" title="Wiki + Searchable Notes">Wiki + searchable notes</a>. I mentioned that I was now using the github clone feature for the wiki, allowing me to work on the wiki locally and then push changes to the server with git push. Another benefit of this approach, it makes it very easy to add images to the wiki. </p>

<p>The problem was it took too many steps to go from capturing the screen, saving it, and finally linking to it in the wiki/notes file. So I created a TextExpander snippet to do all of this in 2 steps (OSX only)</p>

<ol>
<li>screen capture (ctrl-cmd-shift-4)</li>
<li>type &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; into the editor where I want the image to be placed.</li>
</ol>


<p>First you need <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="TextExpander">TextExpander</a> and also you need to install <a href="https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste" title="pngpaste">pngpaste</a> a small bit of code that handles saving a clipboard image to a png file.</p>

<p>Then you just need this snippet (I used &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; as the snippet abbreviation):</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4321473.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I chose to just use a UUID for the file name to keep it simple and unique for each file.</p>

<p>I added this as a snippet in TextExpander and now instead of 10+ steps across 3 apps my workflow for getting a screen capture into a wiki page is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>screen capture (ctrl-cmd-shift-4)</li>
<li>type &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; into the editor where I want the image to be placed.</li>
</ol>


<p>The result: typing &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; causes the last clipboard item to be saved as a png in the wiki images directory and the &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; text I just typed is replaced with the markup for the image that was just saved. Quick and simple.</p>
