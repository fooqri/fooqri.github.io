  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a logophile, and regularly looking up the meanings of words I encounter on the web or in pdf documents. More recent OS X versions include a great feature that allows you to get a quick definition in almost any app (browser, editor, etc). Highlight a word and press <em>ctrl-command-d</em> to get the definition of the word. It is easy to configure to include Wikipedia definitions so you can also look up people and concepts.</p>

<p>To customize which dictionaries are used (including wikipedia entries) open spotlight (command-space), type dictionary and press return to open the dictionary app. Open the preferences menu and tick the checkbox for the sources you wish to use. Once you make pressing <em>ctrl-command-d</em> a habit you will find using it is very natural, and requires little thought to remember it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have wikipedia configured and then try it on these:</p>

<ul>
<li>crepuscule</li>
<li>quiescent</li>
<li>Malta</li>
<li>Thomas Bayes</li>
<li>Markov chain</li>
</ul>


<p>The pop-up definition is interactive so click on a definition to see the full definition entry then use the back arrow to get back to the list of definitions. You can also click on the source title to open the dictionary app with that entry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past year I have had the opportunity to advise a number of people I have worked with in the past who are starting companies. In the past few years my role had been that of a director of both design and R&amp;D teams and so I enjoy continuing that type of role in providing direction to these exciting new startup ventures.</p>

<p>One thing  many of these early phase projects lack is clarity and proper measurement of the problem and opportunity; having only a vague sense of their relative probability of success given their chosen direction versus alternative approaches.</p>

<p>Lately a lot of new startups tend to point to some fuzzy “user experience” as their advantage, and why they will succeed. As a design director I know that this is B.S. and even design and user experience contributions can be measured to a reasonable degree of confidence.</p>

<p>More times than I care to say, I have pointed teams to read and practice the techniques in <em>&ldquo;How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business&rdquo;</em> by Douglas Hubbard.</p>

<p>The first response is always, “Read a book, are you serious” — yes I am serious, this is a good book and for many people it provides some very important tools for success around estimation and prediction. If you learn and use this on your project it will become automatic for you, and require little thought. It just takes practice.</p>

<p>Here are just a few key excerpts to motivate you to read it:</p>

<p><em>There are three reasons why people think things can’t be measured, all are misconceptions about different aspects of measurement: Concept, Object, and Method.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Concept of Measurement. The definition of measurement itself is widely misunderstood. If one understands what measurement means, a lot more things become possible.</li>
<li>Object of measurement. The thing being measured is not well defined. Sloppy and ambiguous language gets in the way of measurement.</li>
<li>Methods of measurement. Many procedures of empirical observation are not well known. If people were familiar with some of the basic methods, it would become apparent that many things thought to be immeasurable are not only measurable but may already have been measured.</li>
</ol>


<p>Hubbard does a good job of making it clear that these three misconceptions are easily overcome, and you can learn to measure anything quickly. More importantly perhaps, you will end up with a better defined question or problem through the process of identifying measures.</p>

<p>He uses a definition of measurement based on uncertainty  that is very powerful, echoing Shannon’s information theory of entropy:</p>

<blockquote><p>Measurement is a quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations.</p></blockquote>

<p>By framing measurement as “uncertainty reduction,” Hubbard has solved the problem for many people who get stuck thinking of measurement as an impossibly exact science. For as Hubbard points out, even inexact measurement is valuable if it reduces uncertainty by some non-trivial amount. This is especially true when investment in the project is high.</p>

<p>He spends several chapters on techniques for determining what to measure and how, and then get’s into what I found to be a great exercise for teams.  It involves calibration of estimation for team members. By evaluating how calibrated people are at estimation (usually not!) we can get the team to understand they they need to improve, and more importantly with the right tools they can learn to be quite proficient at estimation. Having this skill will help them in many ways in their day-to-day work.</p>

<p>Hubbard  discusses the terrible misunderstanding and misuse of risk management in business and R&amp;D projects. <em>You know, those useless Low/Med/High values people put on their slides!</em> He instead prescribes the use of basic confidence intervals and shows the reader how to use them.</p>

<p><strong>A simple example is his test of confidence.</strong></p>

<p>For a given question you provide a range you believe has a 90% CI. For example you say with 90% confidence the module will take you 2-3 days to code, unit test, and submit to system test. Or the wireframe will take you 3-6 hours to update, get reviewed, and hand to engineering.</p>

<p>Then ask yourself this: Suppose I offered you a chance to win $1000 in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>You win $1,000 if you your estimation turns out to be correct. If not, you win nothing.</li>
<li>You spin a dial divided into two unequal “pie slices,” one comprising 90% of the dial and the other just 10%. If the dial lands on the large slice, you win $1,000. If it lands on the small slice, you win nothing (i.e., there is a 90% chance you win $1,000).</li>
</ol>


<p>About 80% of people choose option 2, but why would this be if their estimate is of 90% CI or higher. In reality they probably are more like 50%-80% confident. For those who choose option 1, it could also mean they are over 90% confidence but being conservative in estimating, this can be equally undesirable.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>Equivalent Bet Test</strong>. You should try to set up a mental test like this when assessing confidence and if you pick the wheel then keep lowering the win percentage on the wheel (80%, 70%, 60%, …) until you don’t pick the wheel, that will tell you your real confidence in the answer. Research shows turning it into a bet (real or pretend) increases the quality of the estimates.</p>

<p>People who are very good at assessing their uncertainty (i.e. they are right 80% of the time they say they are 80% confident, etc.) are called calibrated. <em>It is good to be calibrated, projects and life become more predictable.</em></p>

<p>This was just a short teaser of a simple technique, but there are more techniques. I highly recommend Hubbard’s book for anyone involved in complex  endeavors whether on their own or in teams. You will find problems are more clearly articulated once you have  figured out how to measure it; having good calibration in estimation will also significantly reduce your project risk and improve your decision making significantly.</p>

<p>There was a recent question on Quora: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Engineering-Management/Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3">Why are software development task estimations regularly off by a factor of 2-3?</a> That I believe is true because of teams not doing proper analysis, but also it is a multiplier effect of bad estimation across a team. Because of interdependencies of teams these estimation errors can cause huge estimation errors when rolled together.

<time datetime="2013-01-01T10:10:00-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 1<span>st</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using Omnigraffle to create activity diagrams associated with user stories. Some people may find this overkill but I find doing these diagrams makes transitions clear that might otherwise be missed until later when they lead to costly re-architecting of the screens and flows.</p>

<p>I use Omnigraffle for UI wireframes, so it seemed natural to use it for activity diagrams, which is what I have been doing.  The issue is keeping the diagrams up to date.  Today, while playing with the <a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/">Ragel</a> state machine compiler I discovered Ragel&rsquo;s awesome states/transitions diagramming feature. I learned the feature uses <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> to create the diagrams from the parser grammar.  This led me to <a href="https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz/">Ruby Graphviz</a>, a Ruby library for interacting with Graphviz. It got me thinking that maybe there was a simple DSL that could be used to describe UI activities and screens and then automatically generate diagrams from the description. This would make keeping descriptions and diagrams in sync very easy.</p>

<p>My first step is always to get a piece of the most basic idea working, then add another piece, etc until a basic prototype is complete. Given this approach the first step was to use ruby-graphviz to create a basic diagram similar to one of our activity diagrams (a very basic one). So here was a quick pass experiment for using ruby-graphvis to create a diagram. The next step would be to define a basic DSL and then write a parser and state-machine and incorporate the graph creation into the state machine as it parses the DSL activity description.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4431708.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This above very simple example creates the diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/61f780009a654f9724bcd4a9c703d9b4/tumblr_inline_mfz8syDgFP1qz562v.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This needs some cleanup of the aesthetics but the possibility is interesting. The next steps will be to come up with a very simple dsl, as simple as possible, maybe something that is markdown compliant so it fits inside our wiki pages cleanly. It would need to cover start and end states as well as intermediate state nodes. It would need to also handle decision points (diamonds) as well as transitions (edges) and notes. The simplest form would be to allow listing all nodes and all decisions, and then listing the connections between them. Labels would also be needed on all of these. IDs would probably help for wiring up the connections.</p>

<p>Then it is a matter of running a parser on the wiki pages, looking for the syntax associated with the activity descriptions and generating a diagram using some ruby code. This might be a nice experiment to familiarize myself with Ragel to better understand its strengths and capabilities.</p>

<p>I hope to get to spend some free time on this over the coming weeks, as it seems like a fun side project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had my caps lock key mapped to the control key for the last few months as I have migrated back to Emacs from TextMate. It was a slight improvement over the placement of the control key but not a huge improvement. I came across this article: <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/a-useful-caps-lock-key/">A Useful CAPS-Lock Key</a> from Brett Terpstra and decided to give his mapping a try. This mapping requires free third party software, but I was particularly intrigued not by the escape key mapping, which is very handy, but by the &ldquo;Hyper-key&rdquo; (ctrl-shift-cmd-opt) being mapped to holding down the shift key. This opens a lot of potential system wide shortcut key-bindings that are a lot easier than using the uncomfortable ctrl-shift-cmd-opt.</p>

<p>So far it is very useful, I like the hyper-t for opening iTerm2 in visor mode, very handy. I will check back in in a month on this topic and share any other key bindings I come up with.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the holiday I had some time to investigate parsing expression grammers. I had done work in Lex and Yacc many years back when I was responsible for some kernel functionality and related system management kernel commands for a proprietary commercial operating system. I don&rsquo;t remember fondly my time working with Yacc. But then I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">PEGs</a> and the <a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">Treetop</a> Ruby library. It allows the use of simple grammer rules based in regular expressions and creates a parser ruby class from the grammer that can then be used in a ruby program. It also allows ruby blocks to be embedded directly into the grammer rules.</p>

<p>For our startup we have a core feature that includes some user generated instructions that are meant to create a mobile experience for others to participate in, sort of a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">FSM</a> driven experience. We could present the authoring environment in  a form-based interface, but this seemed a bit too restrictive. We may still go with forms, but I wanted to try an intermediate format using user readable text files, so we could write up test cases fast and easy, and compile them into the FSM class. I was also inspired by the simplicity of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> syntax and the way it is used in <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a>. It may not pan out but I really had fun working on it.</p>

<p>I will post some code in the future, but thought I would post a link to the <a href="http://www.trsolutions.biz/blog/2010/03/10/treetop-introductory-tutorial-1-of-10/">tutorial</a> I found very helpful in getting my experiment up and running quickly. It is a well written tutorial that starts with the basics of getting a simple parser working, and then explores just enough complexity to get you to a place where a moderately complex grammer can be written. I think this is a great tool for any Ruby developer&rsquo;s tool belt; and for certain classes of problems related to parsing information it is a very eloquent approach.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using the <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/">FoldingText</a> app for  a couple of weeks. It is a very interesting app targeting writers, something I am not, but I was intrigued by the  interactivity of this minimalist app. Specifically the ability to add interactive todo lists and timers and have them execute in a text document. Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.foldingtext.com/#watchmovie">FoldingText Video</a> to get a feel for it, I don&rsquo;t want to describe ideas that a video shows so clearly.</p>

<p>I have been using it for my daily plan the past 2 weeks. I usually start each day with a mix of items I want to accomplish. These items usually include a mix of coding items for a sprint, some user stories for the backlog, and some wireframes for a future sprint, etc.  The mix keeps the day feeling balanced. I add a mix of these to the day&rsquo;s plan, and then organize them into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro</a> time slices.</p>

<p>The app&rsquo;s simplicity allows some really interesting customization that isn&rsquo;t present in an app like Vitamin-R, which is a good pomodoro app, but like most apps is not very flexible. For example, I have found that keeping the daily plan, now and later notes, and the time slices all in a single document is very powerful. Further I can add notes indented under time slices to describe what I did during each slice. Since everything is in a single text document (markdown) and lives in my nvALT notes app, I can easily search and find my daily notes that include what I accomplished each day, etc. This is good for reviewing how well certain activities mix together, looking at my velocity over time, etc.</p>

<p>All of that is useful but the reason for my making this post is that I find the interaction model to be very interesting, basically a text document with very simple embedded mini-apps that are triggered by simple human-readable phrases that add functionality while the document is open and in use. With all output living in the text document. It gives hints of a feeing of empowerment that early spreadsheet apps like Lotus123 delivered. I can imagine all sorts of useful embedded mini-apps, the key will be maintaining the simplicity. Many apps used for productivity today are incredibly prescriptive, FoldingText feels like you are really in control and able to customize the document as a very simple app. Of course FoldingText itself is still more of an app than a platform, but I can imagine it as a platform with many developers adding these mini-apps. Todo lists and timers seem like a powerful start, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what comes next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For our startup I have been using github wiki to keep the product specs, design docs, user stories, etc organized and up-to-date. The nice thing about github is you can clone the wiki and work on it locally and push changes up to the server. See this <a href="https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/wiki/Editing-Wiki-Locally" title="writeup" target="_blank">writeup</a> for more info. This is handy because you can then work on the wiki using markdown syntax in a regular text editor versus a web page editor.</p>

<p>The ease of this made me wonder if there was a way to do my normal note taking, code journalling, etc in markdown vs Evernote. I did some looking around and found <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/" title="nvAlt" target="_blank">nvALT</a>, which is a markdown based notebook that can save notes as flat .md files.</p>

<p>So as an experiment I cloned my personal notes wiki from github.  After configuring nvALT to use the cloned wiki directory as its directory I could immediately see and search all of my wiki files as nvALT note files. Also I could add new files and they would now become linkable as wiki files. So basically nvALT acts as a note taking system, but notes can be also linked together via a mmd link notation that is supported by the github wiki. You can install the <a href="https://github.com/github/gollum" title="Gollum">gollum</a> gem and interact with the wiki locally to test the wiki pages.</p>

<p>So I can now create, edit, search notes in markdown, but also link them, as well as view them as a wiki.</p>

<p>I will post again after a few weeks trying out the solution with more info on how it is working.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Doing iOS design and development I find myself capturing images on the iPhone all the time to make notes on. These usually end up being added to my notes or to our project wiki (see <a href="http://fooqri.tumblr.com/post/38160399193/screen-capture-goodness" title="Screen Capture Goodness">Screen capture goodness</a> and  <a href="http://fooqri.tumblr.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes" title="Wiki + Searchable Notes">Wiki + Searchable Notes</a> for more on that).</p>

<p>To get the images from the phone to my Mac I was using Apple&rsquo;s Photo Stream feature but it took too long and sometime images just didn&rsquo;t show up on the Mac. So I went looking for a better solution and found the <a href="http://www.photosync-app.com/" title="PhotoSync">PhotoSynch </a>app in the app store. You install it on the iphone via the ios app store ($1.99), and on the Mac via the Mac app store (Free).</p>

<p>It can then be configured to synch all the images in your camera roll with the Mac over wifi. It has a quick transfer feature that allows it to transfer all images since the last sync to the Mac.</p>

<p>You start the transfer on the phone, and when it completes a Finder window will appear on the Mac so you can see the images. At this point I use script to move certain images into the right folders. The process is quick, simple, and works every time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>tl;wr</h3>

<p>Take the shell script from below and create a TextExpander snippet to save any image in your OS X clipboard to disk with a unique uuid.png name, and automatically create a markdown image link that is pasted in place in your editor.</p>

<h3>verbose</h3>

<p>When making notes on wireframes, screen designs, activity diagrams, etc, I have a particular workflow where I do a screen capture and want to link the result in my markdown notes or from our project wiki. The power of markdown text files is their portability, the challenge can be losing the rich cut and paste of apps like Evernote.</p>

<p>In a previous post <a href="http://fooqri.tumblr.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes" title="Wiki + Searchable Notes">Wiki + searchable notes</a>. I mentioned that I was now using the github clone feature for the wiki, allowing me to work on the wiki locally and then push changes to the server with git push. Another benefit of this approach, it makes it very easy to add images to the wiki. </p>

<p>The problem was it took too many steps to go from capturing the screen, saving it, and finally linking to it in the wiki/notes file. So I created a TextExpander snippet to do all of this in 2 steps (OSX only)</p>

<ol>
<li>screen capture (ctrl-cmd-shift-4)</li>
<li>type &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; into the editor where I want the image to be placed.</li>
</ol>


<p>First you need <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="TextExpander">TextExpander</a> and also you need to install <a href="https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste" title="pngpaste">pngpaste</a> a small bit of code that handles saving a clipboard image to a png file.</p>

<p>Then you just need this snippet (I used &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; as the snippet abbreviation):</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4321473.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I chose to just use a UUID for the file name to keep it simple and unique for each file.</p>

<p>I added this as a snippet in TextExpander and now instead of 10+ steps across 3 apps my workflow for getting a screen capture into a wiki page is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>screen capture (ctrl-cmd-shift-4)</li>
<li>type &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; into the editor where I want the image to be placed.</li>
</ol>


<p>The result: typing &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; causes the last clipboard item to be saved as a png in the wiki images directory and the &ldquo;wpng&rdquo; text I just typed is replaced with the markup for the image that was just saved. Quick and simple.</p>
