  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my continued experiments with <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">Polymer</a>, I created a web component that wraps  <a href="http://nvd3.org/" target="_blank">NVD3</a> &ndash; a reusable chart library for  <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3.js</a>.
As part of the activity I ported all of the  <a href="http://nvd3.org/examples/index.html" target="_blank">NVD3 example charts</a> to a web component I am calling <em>&lt;goddip-charts></em>. The component is contained in a <a href="http://www.poggr.com/pekqyTpXDEe:deJoY70GdVx" target="_blank">pogg</a> on <a href="http://www.poggr.com/home/" target="_blank">poggr.com</a>, as this is where I do my experimenting and it allows me to code and serve the project documents in the one place.</p>

<iframe width="680px" height="380px" src="http://www.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlym9bhp4Lx::53"></iframe>


<p></p>

<p>The above chart is an iframe to <a href="http://www.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlym9bhp4Lx::53" target="_blank">this document</a> The actual element tag used is as follows:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;goddip-charts  
   class="small-chart-styles"
   chartType="bar"
   context="/pg1GXbi9MBx:deyDCclAEUg::53" 
   css="/pg1GXbi9MBx:dxkNM7ZicfBe::53" &gt;
 &lt;/goddip-charts &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To view the uncompiled and unminified source see (<a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlym9bhp4Lx::49" target="_blank">html document source</a>, <a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:deyDCclAEUg::49" target="_blank">data document source</a>, and <a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dxkNM7ZicfBe::49" target="_blank">style document source</a>).</p>

<p>The best way to learn about the <em>&lt;goddip-charts></em> component is to take a look at its <a href="http://www.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dgJXG7boqzSe" target="_blank">README document</a>. This describes how to use each of the charts, reference data, add styling, etc. You can always view the component <a href="http://source.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx:dlJkI7k9tBe" target="_blank">source</a>. If you have a <em>poggr.com</em> account you can view, clone, and edit <em>goddip-charts</em> using the <a href="http://project.poggr.com/pg1GXbi9MBx" target="_blank">poggr project UI</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As an emacs/<a href="http://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">org-mode</a>/<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/" target="_blank">babel</a> user I have always been fascinated with the potential of literate programming and combining inline code in my notes. I have many org-mode documents that interactively execute code for various tasks and procedures. These tasks includes certain maintenance activities, or destructive operations I don&rsquo;t want to get wrong. I have an entire org document devoted to db maintenance, filled with Ruby code to execute complicated db queries and operations.  It is nice to see the example code inline in my notes, and be able to modify the code and execute it directly in my notes. This works especially well for checklist types of notes where calculations or actions are called for. You might even say org-mode was one inspiration for building <em><a href="http://www.poggr.com/home" target="_blank">poggr.com</a></em>; creating a browser based tool that is simple, flexible, and powerful for creating interactive and compelling documents that work in any web browser.</p>

<p>The potential of browser-based literate programming is why I find the idea of <em>Literate CoffeeScript</em> facinating. It is not just the idea of documenting code or even the idea of describing code in a blog post. It is the idea of creating flexible and effective browser based <em>task</em> and <em>tool</em> documents. The power in these types of documents is you see the code you are executing, which is extremely useful for programmer&rsquo;s notes. It seems literate CoffeeScript might have something to say about how to create browser-based interactive notes that include inline code, like emacs/org-mode/babel has done for emacs users.</p>

<p>Since <em><a href="http://www.poggr.com/home" target="_blank">poggr.com</a></em> supports compiling CoffeeScript into JavaScript  I decided to turn on literate CoffeeScript and give it a go to see if this is a legitimate way to combine code and blogging in a single pogg document.</p>

<h3>Poggr CoffeeScript Compilation</h3>

<p>The way poggr works is that when you save a <em>CoffeeScript</em> document <em>poggr</em> keeps both source code and compiled <em>JavaScript</em> code. Just like when you save a <em>markdown</em> document poggr saves both the source markdown and the compiled html. When a document is requested using a <em>poggid</em> in an http request, poggr will deliver the compiled code unless a query parameter is used to request source. This works out quite well in most cases, since the compiled version is what browsers are expecting (html, css, JavaScript). This model allows poggr to support other markup and languages like <em>less</em>, <em>scss</em>, <em>yaml</em>, etc to work similarly.</p>

<p><em>LitCoffeeScript</em> is unique in that compilation produces two documents (markdown &ndash;> html) and (CoffeeScript &ndash;> JavaScript). Thus, one challenge is knowing whether a document request is for the  html or JavaScript version. I felt compelled enough to experiment that I added a test case where adding a <strong>.js</strong> extention to a <em>poggid</em> will return the JavaScript, otherwise it will return the compiled html version of the document.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script src="//www.poggr.com/peJo73gk0Nx:dxkfEl2RANx.js"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I wanted to pick something fun to experiment with so I chose a game originally created by <em><a href="https://gist.github.com/macournoyer">Marc-André Cournoyer</a></em>.
in his <em><a href="https://gist.github.com/macournoyer/7357908" target="_blank">game.litcoffee</a></em> gist.</p>

<p>You can see my version of the  literate CoffeeScript post in action <a href="http://goddip.poggr.com/peJo73gk0Nx:dxkfEl2RANx" target="_blank">here</a>. What you will notice it the game is running as part of the post, and all the code is also embedded in the post. This may look like a normal code example post, but if you look at the  <a href="//source.poggr.com/peJo73gk0Nx:dxkfEl2RANx" target="_blank">source code</a> you will see at the end of the source document that the post actually loads the js version of itself. So by saving a literate CoffeeScript document you automatically get a blog post; in addition all of the fenced  CoffeeScript code is compiled into a JavaScript document.  Any changed inline code is re-compiled into an updated JavaScript document with each save. <strong><em>Mind Blown right!</em></strong></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t see it replacing my emacs/org/babel workflow yet, but it certainly opens some possibilities for having a set of private online notes, experiments, and tools I can call up in any browser to edit and execute. One down-side is while emacs is mode-less in that editing and execution happen together, the browser model is built for view-only. Poggr is built on browser-based document editing, but viewing the rendered results is still a separate action. Although it is not exactly the same emacs/org-mode, there are cases where it is actually better. Emacs does not excel where rich visualization and rendering are beneficial, this is what the browser does best.</p>

<p>When I get a chance I will port a few of my org-mode notes over to literate CoffeeScript documents on poggr and make a note here when they are up.</p>

<p>Using Google spreadsheets is a great way for a team to collaborate on a data set but it leaves a bit to be desired on presentation of the data. To that end I will be creating a series of fun examples showing how to build small interactive apps that utilize <em>Google Docs</em> and <em>Polymer</em> web components to quickly bring data to life. In this series I will be using a Google spreadsheet as the data source, but other data sources are possible, and I will get to those as well in future posts.</p>

<p>The first example is  <strong><em><a href="http://fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dgyFhkQ9M8e">Hipster List</a></em></strong>, an app that shows cool places to visit in various cities. Check out the <strong><em><a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">README</a></em></strong> document for details on how this app is put together.</p>

<p><a href="//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdHRaTlI3Y2EydllTa2NsRjlxRVhMRlE&usp=sharing#gid=0"><img class="spreadsheet-screen" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/goddip-poggs/pgyUYTfcMUe/spreadsheet_screen.png"></a></p>

<p>A little convention is used to make it work. Namely, I use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahy9ODkMXc1GdHRaTlI3Y2EydllTa2NsRjlxRVhMRlE&amp;usp=sharing">Hipster Hot Spots</a> Google spreadsheet, where each city&rsquo;s data is represented by a tab in the spreadsheet. There is also a <em>key</em> tab that provides a list of all the cities in the spreadsheet and the tab id (<em>gid</em>) for each city&rsquo;s data. The app will load its data from the spreadsheet and populate the city drop-down list of <em>hot spots</em>, and display a map with markers for each <em>hot spot</em>. This was a fun first example, remember to checkout the <a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">readme document</a> for code and explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I enabled url fragment parameters so you can easily point the app at your own copy of the spreadsheet for testing. See the <a href="//fooqri.poggr.com/pgyUYTfcMUe:dxJgUYaGcGUl">readme document</a> for the how-to instructions. Feel free to copy the spreadsheet and try out the app with your own list of cities and <em>hot spots</em>.</p>

<p> Separating code and data is always beneficial, but there is something cool about connecting an app to a Google spreadsheet. There are many spreadsheet users who would like to have an app to visualize their data, but may not be up to the coding challenge yet. I think many small useful apps could be built this way;  I will pick a few to build in the next few weeks and discuss them here. I am using the <em><a href="//www.poggr.com/home">poggr.com</a></em> service for the example, which is a service I built just for these types of small quick apps that can rely on an external data service. It is basically working to merge interactive content creation and blogging into a single service.</p>

<p> Leave me a comment if you have an small spreadsheet driven app you would like me to build. If it seems reasonable I may add it to the list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is sometimes handy to turn on CoreData.SQLDebug in the simulator when debugging a Core Data issue. I have found the output to be very useful in finding the hard to find little bugs that pop-up between restkit and core data. It can also help find performance issues with the database.  Unfortunately there isn&rsquo;t any documentation for how to do this in RubyMotion. I found one solution that works to a degree. It requires installing the ios_sim app and forcing the simulator into CoreData.SQLDebug mode after the rubymotion build.</p>

<p>You will need to install ios_sim</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install ios-sim
</code></pre>

<p>Then add the following two line as the last lines in your RubyMotion rakefile</p>

<pre><code># Be sure to substitute your app name and make sure you are using
# the correct path to the app based on simulator version.
ios_sim = `which ios-sim`.strip
sh "#{ios_sim} launch build/iPhoneSimulator-6.1-Development/appname.app --args -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1"
</code></pre>

<p>This will open the simulator in CoreData.SQLDebug mode, and log debug information to the terminal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note, I was getting an undefined constant error for
RKLogConfigureByName, the standard way of setting up logging in
RestKit. It seems that the #define statements in the
<em>/vendor/Pods/RestKit/Code/Support/RKLog.h</em> file are not getting
picked up. I am using the pod and loading with RubyMotion pod support,
so Iåm not sure what the issue is. I will need to investigate further
but this quick workaround works, just call the lower-level method
mapped via the #define. For example instead of RKLogConfigureByName
use RKlcl_configure_by_name.  I also list all the RKlcl_v constants to
use instead of the RKLogLevel constants. I also included an example of
how they are used, in this case I have put the setup in a method, and
it gets called from the the standard didFinishLaunchingWithOption
application block.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous post <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes">wiki-searchable-notes</a> I mentioned that I was using nvALT for note taking. nvALT is a very simple way to create and search notes and store them in flat files that can be used by other tools. One use is publishing to a github wiki, today I will discuss another.</p>

<p>I am an Emacs user and often found myself dropping out of emacs to find a note I needed in nvALT. I went looking for the best way to index and access my nvALT notes inside Emacs, and found the very cool emacs script called <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">Deft</a> that works with <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">EMacs Markdown Mode</a> to create the equivalent of nvALT inside of emacs. It can be configured to work with the nvALT repository so they work well together.</p>

<p>A few pointers&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use markdown in nvALT as I do, follow the instructions to install <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">markdown-mode</a> via git clone.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to install  <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">Deft</a> via git clone. It is an active repository, so clone makes keeping up-to-date easy. Also update init.el to require the deft.el script.</li>
<li>For markdown and nvALT using the flat file config (see  <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes">wiki-searchable-notes</a> for flat file config) you need to add a few additional expressions in init.el. Add these four lines as discussed on the deft documentation.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(setq deft-extension "md")
</span><span class='line'>(setq deft-directory "~/Development/wikis/Notes.wiki/")
</span><span class='line'>(setq deft-text-mode 'markdown-mode)
</span><span class='line'>(setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions to map a keyboard shortcut to open deft. I use H-d (see my <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/41867238595/emacs-experimental-hyper-key-mappings">emacs hyper-key post</a> ) but a simple function key mapping would be.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(global-set-key [f8] 'deft)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>    <br/>
* Create a symlink from ~/.deft to your nvALT notes directory, this is shown in the nvALT preferences under the notes tab. See example below.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ln -s ~/Documents/notes/ .deft</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you eval init.el or restart emacs you should be set. Fire up Deft and the UI will operate just like nvALT, only it works in an Emacs buffer!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous post <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/39243391147/remapping-my-caps-lock-key">Remapping My Caps Lock Key</a> I mentioned that I remapped my caps-lock key to escape, but also created a &ldquo;hyper-key&rdquo; (ctrl-shift-cmd-opt) when the caps-lock key is held down. This opens up a keyboard worth of new shortcuts for emacs. Here are a few I have been playing with for the past few days. An alternative key mapping would be to map the hyper key to holding down the tab key, if you already have the caps lock key mapped to control, and thus muscle memory might preclude this mapping from working for you.</p>

<p>H is the remapped caps-lock HyperKey from my earlier post, which translates as C-M-S-s in the emacs init.el key-mappings. I include an init.el excerpt at the end of the post for all of these mappings.</p>

<ul>
<li>(H-l) This will mark the entire current line, from any position on the line. Using the arrow keys will extent the selection one line at a time either up or down.</li>
<li>(H-f) This invokes text expansion for code completion, I do this a lot so I wanted it to be very comfortable.</li>
<li>(H-3) This invokes the comment/uncomment function on a region, ruby comment is the # so I thought I would try this binding.</li>
<li>(H-Right Arrow) This opens a new window to the right of the current window, I do this often enough I wanted it to be quick</li>
<li>(H-Left Arrow) This closes the current window, sort of the opposite of Right arrow.</li>
<li>(H-Down Arrow) This opens a new window below the current window</li>
<li>(H-p) In the current window switch to the previous buffer</li>
<li>(H-n) In the current window switch to the next buffer</li>
<li>(H-delete) Kill this buffer</li>
<li>(H-w) Quick copy line, pressing multiple times adds more lines to the copy</li>
<li>(H-k) Quick cut line, pressing multiple times adds more lines to the cut</li>
<li>(H-c) Copy region into register (prompts for register number)</li>
<li>(H-v) Paste from register (prompts for register number)</li>
<li>(H-spacebar) Open a popup shell in directory of current buffer.</li>
<li>(H-e) Eval buffer, mostly used to eval init.el after tweaks</li>
</ul>


<p>I will likely be tweaking more in the upcoming weeks as I experiment with key mappings, I will post an update after I get a chance to work with the hyper-key for a while, and settle on a favorite set of key-mappings. See the excerpt from my init.el below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have been using RubyMotion for iOS development; I really  appreciate developing in Ruby, and prefer Emacs to Xcode. Compared to using interface builder, styling apps can be a challenge. It is possible to use RubyMotion with XIB files created in Xcode&rsquo;s Interface Builder, but I have been trying to avoid this. I am striving for a more web-app like design and development workflow.</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/teacup">teacup</a>, which takes a declarative approach to styling and uses a CSS-like DSL. Although I liked teacup, I had been anxiously awaiting the arrival of <a href="http://www.pixate.com/">Pixate</a> because of its support for CSS-based styling. Pixate became generally available this month, and I purchased a license. The license is $199, and although expensive, a small price compared to time saved if it works. Since I already do a lot of CSS work on the web side it seems like a nice way to leverage my CSS skills and experience. The Pixate team along with the RubyMotion team created a <a href="https://github.com/Pixate/RubyMotion-Pixate">RubyMotion-Pixate gem</a> that makes it easy to get Pixate working with RubyMotion.</p>

<p>After 2 days of coding I have my basic controllers in place as well as several TableViewControllers. I have used Pixate to style many of the elements. With Pixate you can style with four types of selectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>element type selector &ndash; Select a control by element name</li>
<li>universal selector &ndash; Select any control</li>
<li>class selector &ndash; Select a control by class name</li>
<li>id selector &ndash; Select a control by ID</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/tony-fadell-unique-nature-apples-design-process">this interview</a> with Tony Fadell on the unique nature of Apple&rsquo;s design process. The discussion about project abandonment percentages is incredibly important, and often overlooked in large companies. In many cases abandonment is a financial decision related to either real or opportunity costs associated with launching a product. People who have never worked for a large consumer products company likely have no idea how many products are cancelled just before launch because of the incredible cost in launching a product into the market.</p>

<p>Tony makes an amazing point about the toll such high cancellation rates have on employees at a company, and on the quality of the products the company ships. The inverse is that high commitment to ship products that pass key milestones leads to better employee commitment.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When you’re in a culture that has a point of view, and drives to launch everything it does, you know you’re on the hook and you better bring your best game every time,&rdquo; Fadell explained.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tony contrasts his experience at Apple with his experience at Philips:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fadell explained that a key and yet often overlooked difference between Apple and other tech companies is that Apple ships 99% of the products that pass certain internal milestones. By way of contrast, during Fadell&rsquo;s tenure at Philips &ndash; where he was charged with overseeing the company&rsquo;s audio strategy &ndash; the iPod guru noted that Philips would axe 9 projects out of 10, even if a particular product was about to ship.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think large companies have a metric for tracking the number and impact of cancelled projects. In my experience executive teams wanted to forget cancellations as quickly as possible and move on. They considered the cost to be in the past, and by having cancelled the project they had cut any ongoing cost.  But as Tony points out, there are ongoing costs, just not costs that have their own column on a balance sheet or scorecard. In my experience it was clear &hellip; the impact of cancellations were cumulative and devastating.</p>

<p>The importance of commitment is actually one of the 3 c&rsquo;s I use when evaluating a project: <em>Clarity</em>, <em>Competency</em>, and <em>Commitment</em>. Over the years I have found these to be the key pieces of early stage information that will best predict the success of a project. Tony&rsquo;s pont about commitment is that it isn&rsquo;t only about commitment to a project, it is about the culture of commitment in an organization. I like this point, and I imagine there is a corollary for organizational clarity and competency. Below are a few notes related to project level evaluation of the 3 c&rsquo;s</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an earlier post <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/40689737812/simple-state-machine-example">Simple state machine example</a>, I provided an example of using the Ruby <em>state_machine</em> gem to create a state machine for handling a simple list of tasks. In this post I will provide a similar but not exactly compatible description of building a parser to read lists from a text file. In this example I use the markdown syntax for lists, where items can be placed hierarchically, thus removing the need for a separate &ldquo;list&rdquo; object.</p>

<p>I found the <a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/ragel-guide-6.7.pdf">Ragel documentation</a> to be excellent. The only issue is a lack of practical examples. Given the dearth of examples available, I though I would add my +1 example to help the cause. If you are serious about using Ragel I recommend reading the documentation start to finish quickly, then a second go through taking notes on key items like default machines, syntax, priorities, actions, etc before building a parser. Having a strong base will help tremendously when using examples.</p>

<p>There are three files involved in this solution to the list problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>lists.txt: a data file that contains two lists for the parser to parse.</li>
<li>mdlist.rb: a ruby class that will call the parser and output the list returned from the parser.</li>
<li>mdlist_parser.rl: A file that will be used by Ragel to create a parser class definition (mdlist_parse.rb).</li>
</ul>


<p>I added all three files to one gist, which is shown below. Below the lists.txt data file uses a markdown like syntax where hierarchy is expressed through indentation (4 spaces or a tab).</p>
