  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in my post on <a href="http://godd.io/blog/2013/03/04/nvalt-and-emacs/">nvALT and Emacs</a> I have been using Deft for notes. One change I have made is to switch from using markdown to org-mode. Org-mode is a very powerful tool for not only note taking but when combined with <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/index.html">org-babel</a> is a powerful tool for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate Programming</a>.</p>

<p>With the startup I am coding both server and client, but also managing the server and db environments. I try to be as efficient as possible by writing scripts to do common tasks. One issue is that amount of time that passes between some tasks, and how easy it is to lose the location of scripts, or the order they should be performed.</p>

<p>Checklists can be very handy for remembering, but not always for executing code. So I decided to experiment with literate programming in org-mode to combine checklists with code execution.</p>

<p>TODO:
&ndash; Show DB client lib
&ndash; Show static items like drop and load DB
&ndash; Show dynamic items like running queries.
&ndash; Show an example of creating a report section of the file</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is sometimes handy to turn on CoreData.SQLDebug in the simulator when debugging a Core Data issue. I have found the output to be very useful in finding the hard to find little bugs that pop-up between restkit and core data. It can also help find performance issues with the database.  Unfortunately there isn&rsquo;t any documentation for how to do this in RubyMotion. I found one solution that works to a degree. It requires installing the ios_sim app and forcing the simulator into CoreData.SQLDebug mode after the rubymotion build.</p>

<p>You will need to install ios_sim</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install ios-sim
</code></pre>

<p>Then add the following two line as the last lines in your RubyMotion rakefile</p>

<pre><code># Be sure to substitute your app name and make sure you are using
# the correct path to the app based on simulator version.
ios_sim = `which ios-sim`.strip
sh "#{ios_sim} launch build/iPhoneSimulator-6.1-Development/appname.app --args -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1"
</code></pre>

<p>This will open the simulator in CoreData.SQLDebug mode, and log debug information to the terminal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note, I was getting an undefined constant error for
RKLogConfigureByName, the standard way of setting up logging in
RestKit. It seems that the #define statements in the
<em>/vendor/Pods/RestKit/Code/Support/RKLog.h</em> file are not getting
picked up. I am using the pod and loading with RubyMotion pod support,
so IÃ¥m not sure what the issue is. I will need to investigate further
but this quick workaround works, just call the lower-level method
mapped via the #define. For example instead of RKLogConfigureByName
use RKlcl_configure_by_name.  I also list all the RKlcl_v constants to
use instead of the RKLogLevel constants. I also included an example of
how they are used, in this case I have put the setup in a method, and
it gets called from the the standard didFinishLaunchingWithOption
application block.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous post <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes">wiki-searchable-notes</a> I mentioned that I was using nvALT for note taking. nvALT is a very simple way to create and search notes and store them in flat files that can be used by other tools. One use is publishing to a github wiki, today I will discuss another.</p>

<p>I am an Emacs user and often found myself dropping out of emacs to find a note I needed in nvALT. I went looking for the best way to index and access my nvALT notes inside Emacs, and found the very cool emacs script called <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">Deft</a> that works with <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">EMacs Markdown Mode</a> to create the equivalent of nvALT inside of emacs. It can be configured to work with the nvALT repository so they work well together.</p>

<p>A few pointers&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use markdown in nvALT as I do, follow the instructions to install <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">markdown-mode</a> via git clone.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions to install  <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/">Deft</a> via git clone. It is an active repository, so clone makes keeping up-to-date easy. Also update init.el to require the deft.el script.</li>
<li>For markdown and nvALT using the flat file config (see  <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/38158334752/wiki-searchable-notes">wiki-searchable-notes</a> for flat file config) you need to add a few additional expressions in init.el. Add these four lines as discussed on the deft documentation.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(setq deft-extension "md")
</span><span class='line'>(setq deft-directory "~/Development/wikis/Notes.wiki/")
</span><span class='line'>(setq deft-text-mode 'markdown-mode)
</span><span class='line'>(setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions to map a keyboard shortcut to open deft. I use H-d (see my <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/41867238595/emacs-experimental-hyper-key-mappings">emacs hyper-key post</a> ) but a simple function key mapping would be.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(global-set-key [f8] 'deft)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>    <br/>
* Create a symlink from ~/.deft to your nvALT notes directory, this is shown in the nvALT preferences under the notes tab. See example below.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ln -s ~/Documents/notes/ .deft</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you eval init.el or restart emacs you should be set. Fire up Deft and the UI will operate just like nvALT, only it works in an Emacs buffer!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous post <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/39243391147/remapping-my-caps-lock-key">Remapping My Caps Lock Key</a> I mentioned that I remapped my caps-lock key to escape, but also created a &ldquo;hyper-key&rdquo; (ctrl-shift-cmd-opt) when the caps-lock key is held down. This opens up a keyboard worth of new shortcuts for emacs. Here are a few I have been playing with for the past few days. An alternative key mapping would be to map the hyper key to holding down the tab key, if you already have the caps lock key mapped to control, and thus muscle memory might preclude this mapping from working for you.</p>

<p>H is the remapped caps-lock HyperKey from my earlier post, which translates as C-M-S-s in the emacs init.el key-mappings. I include an init.el excerpt at the end of the post for all of these mappings.</p>

<ul>
<li>(H-l) This will mark the entire current line, from any position on the line. Using the arrow keys will extent the selection one line at a time either up or down.</li>
<li>(H-f) This invokes text expansion for code completion, I do this a lot so I wanted it to be very comfortable.</li>
<li>(H-3) This invokes the comment/uncomment function on a region, ruby comment is the # so I thought I would try this binding.</li>
<li>(H-Right Arrow) This opens a new window to the right of the current window, I do this often enough I wanted it to be quick</li>
<li>(H-Left Arrow) This closes the current window, sort of the opposite of Right arrow.</li>
<li>(H-Down Arrow) This opens a new window below the current window</li>
<li>(H-p) In the current window switch to the previous buffer</li>
<li>(H-n) In the current window switch to the next buffer</li>
<li>(H-delete) Kill this buffer</li>
<li>(H-w) Quick copy line, pressing multiple times adds more lines to the copy</li>
<li>(H-k) Quick cut line, pressing multiple times adds more lines to the cut</li>
<li>(H-c) Copy region into register (prompts for register number)</li>
<li>(H-v) Paste from register (prompts for register number)</li>
<li>(H-spacebar) Open a popup shell in directory of current buffer.</li>
<li>(H-e) Eval buffer, mostly used to eval init.el after tweaks</li>
</ul>


<p>I will likely be tweaking more in the upcoming weeks as I experiment with key mappings, I will post an update after I get a chance to work with the hyper-key for a while, and settle on a favorite set of key-mappings. See the excerpt from my init.el below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have been using RubyMotion for iOS development; I really  appreciate developing in Ruby, and prefer Emacs to Xcode. Compared to using interface builder, styling apps can be a challenge. It is possible to use RubyMotion with XIB files created in Xcode&rsquo;s Interface Builder, but I have been trying to avoid this. I am striving for a more web-app like design and development workflow.</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://github.com/rubymotion/teacup">teacup</a>, which takes a declarative approach to styling and uses a CSS-like DSL. Although I liked teacup, I had been anxiously awaiting the arrival of <a href="http://www.pixate.com/">Pixate</a> because of its support for CSS-based styling. Pixate became generally available this month, and I purchased a license. The license is $199, and although expensive, a small price compared to time saved if it works. Since I already do a lot of CSS work on the web side it seems like a nice way to leverage my CSS skills and experience. The Pixate team along with the RubyMotion team created a <a href="https://github.com/Pixate/RubyMotion-Pixate">RubyMotion-Pixate gem</a> that makes it easy to get Pixate working with RubyMotion.</p>

<p>After 2 days of coding I have my basic controllers in place as well as several TableViewControllers. I have used Pixate to style many of the elements. With Pixate you can style with four types of selectors:</p>

<ul>
<li>element type selector &ndash; Select a control by element name</li>
<li>universal selector &ndash; Select any control</li>
<li>class selector &ndash; Select a control by class name</li>
<li>id selector &ndash; Select a control by ID</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/tony-fadell-unique-nature-apples-design-process">this interview</a> with Tony Fadell on the unique nature of Apple&rsquo;s design process. The discussion about project abandonment percentages is incredibly important, and often overlooked in large companies. In many cases abandonment is a financial decision related to either real or opportunity costs associated with launching a product. People who have never worked for a large consumer products company likely have no idea how many products are cancelled just before launch because of the incredible cost in launching a product into the market.</p>

<p>Tony makes an amazing point about the toll such high cancellation rates have on employees at a company, and on the quality of the products the company ships. The inverse is that high commitment to ship products that pass key milestones leads to better employee commitment.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When youâre in a culture that has a point of view, and drives to launch everything it does, you know youâre on the hook and you better bring your best game every time,&rdquo; Fadell explained.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tony contrasts his experience at Apple with his experience at Philips:</p>

<blockquote><p>Fadell explained that a key and yet often overlooked difference between Apple and other tech companies is that Apple ships 99% of the products that pass certain internal milestones. By way of contrast, during Fadell&rsquo;s tenure at Philips &ndash; where he was charged with overseeing the company&rsquo;s audio strategy &ndash; the iPod guru noted that Philips would axe 9 projects out of 10, even if a particular product was about to ship.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think large companies have a metric for tracking the number and impact of cancelled projects. In my experience executive teams wanted to forget cancellations as quickly as possible and move on. They considered the cost to be in the past, and by having cancelled the project they had cut any ongoing cost.  But as Tony points out, there are ongoing costs, just not costs that have their own column on a balance sheet or scorecard. In my experience it was clear &hellip; the impact of cancellations were cumulative and devastating.</p>

<p>The importance of commitment is actually one of the 3 c&rsquo;s I use when evaluating a project: <em>Clarity</em>, <em>Competency</em>, and <em>Commitment</em>. Over the years I have found these to be the key pieces of early stage information that will best predict the success of a project. Tony&rsquo;s pont about commitment is that it isn&rsquo;t only about commitment to a project, it is about the culture of commitment in an organization. I like this point, and I imagine there is a corollary for organizational clarity and competency. Below are a few notes related to project level evaluation of the 3 c&rsquo;s</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an earlier post <a href="http://www.pragmaux.com/post/40689737812/simple-state-machine-example">Simple state machine example</a>, I provided an example of using the Ruby <em>state_machine</em> gem to create a state machine for handling a simple list of tasks. In this post I will provide a similar but not exactly compatible description of building a parser to read lists from a text file. In this example I use the markdown syntax for lists, where items can be placed hierarchically, thus removing the need for a separate &ldquo;list&rdquo; object.</p>

<p>I found the <a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/ragel-guide-6.7.pdf">Ragel documentation</a> to be excellent. The only issue is a lack of practical examples. Given the dearth of examples available, I though I would add my +1 example to help the cause. If you are serious about using Ragel I recommend reading the documentation start to finish quickly, then a second go through taking notes on key items like default machines, syntax, priorities, actions, etc before building a parser. Having a strong base will help tremendously when using examples.</p>

<p>There are three files involved in this solution to the list problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>lists.txt: a data file that contains two lists for the parser to parse.</li>
<li>mdlist.rb: a ruby class that will call the parser and output the list returned from the parser.</li>
<li>mdlist_parser.rl: A file that will be used by Ragel to create a parser class definition (mdlist_parse.rb).</li>
</ul>


<p>I added all three files to one gist, which is shown below. Below the lists.txt data file uses a markdown like syntax where hierarchy is expressed through indentation (4 spaces or a tab).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Suppose three men can paint three fences in three hours. How long would it take one man to paint one fence?</p></blockquote>

<p>I ran across this interesting problem in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Joy-Guided-Infinity-ebook/dp/B006R8PL7G/ref=tmm_kin_title_0">&ldquo;The Joy of x: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity,&rdquo;</a> a very accessible and interesting tour of mathematics.</p>

<p>It turns out most people quickly answer âone hour.â  As Strogatz opines,</p>

<blockquote><p>The words themselves nudge you that way. The drumbeat in the first sentenceâ three men, three fences, three hoursâ catches your attention by establishing a rhythm, so when the next sentence repeats the pattern with one man, one fence, ____ hours, itâs hard to resist filling in the blank with âone.â The parallel construction suggests an answer thatâs linguistically right but mathematically wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>The correct answer is three hours. It is obvious if you imagine each person painting their own fence for three hours. Remove two people and two fences and you are left with one person, still painting their one fence for three hours, as before.</p>

<p>What struck me about this problem is that it is an incredibly simple, concrete, and visual example of how our brains try to match patterns, but more importantly the side effect that occurs when a pattern is matched. Neuroscience studies suggest that dopamine (a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure) is released when we solve a problem, thus giving us a biological explanation for that wonderful feeling we get when we have solved a problem.</p>

<p>This made me wonder, does our brain perhaps release dopamine when we solve the faux pattern matching problem and <em>tricks</em> us into thinking we solved the actual logic problem? Thus we quickly blurt out the wrong answer.  After all, we have spent a lifetime feeling the dopamine rush when we believe we have the answer to a problem. Strogatz&rsquo;s observation about this particular word problem having two solutions (a pattern solution, and a logic solution) is very interesting, and is likely very related to a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_decision_making">Cognitive Biases</a>. It is perhaps valuable to think about this explicitly when considering information:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the pattern problem being suggested?</li>
<li>What is the logic problem being suggested?</li>
</ul>


<p>And make sure you have the answer the right question when you feel that first burst of dopamine show up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It probably sounds specious, but I have found having a dog around has made me both more productive and more creative. The evidence for this claim is the number of daily messages I post to our team message board that start with the phrase &ldquo;While I was out walking the dog I had this idea&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before getting a dog I would get sucked into a problem and become obsessed with solving it, the kind of linear obsession that leaves no room for creative leaps. What is needed is to allow the problem to marinate in my subconscious, to facilitate the unexpected synaptic connections that occur when you finally let your mind relax. The problem is, obsession with solving the problem makes this type of relaxed mind difficult and leaps of creativity less frequent. I am sure with practice one could recognize the symptoms and use some type of mediation exercise, but for me the answer is walking the dog. The pattern repeats regularly &hellip; I hit a nasty bug or design conundrum, get stuck, and then take the dog out for 15-20 minutes, and the answer suddenly presents itself.</p>

<p>For me, dog walking seems to engage the kind of subconscious pattern matching that provides the keys to unlock many problems. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Wallas">Wallas</a> would have called this the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Incubation">incubation</a> phase of creativity. I think of it as a cousin to MihÃ¡ly CsÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi&rsquo;s concept of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology">flow</a>) mental state. This seems to be validated by Nardi&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGfhQTbcqmA">work</a> on the neuroscience of personality. Specifically, the brain imaging results where he describes the delta state in terms of CsÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi&rsquo;s flow, but adds that &ldquo;also on occasion when we are copacetic, open to whatever comes next.&rdquo; This is a perfect description of my mental state on a walk with the dog. I feel close to that feeling of flow, but not quite the same &mdash; an approximation. But it seems to do the trick. As a side note, Nardiâs brain imaging results of people watching TV shows up as black; similar to a deep non-dreaming sleep. So TV is not so good for creativity &hellip; just saying.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t find that walking alone or with another person works as well. I wonder if it is the non-conversational interactions with the dog, just enough interaction to get me to stop focussing on the issue, but not so much that my mind is focussed on keeping up a conversation with someone else. Whatever the reason, it works; almost always presenting a promising new direction, if not an outright answer.</p>

<p>This is my muse, Archer, the retired racing greyhound.</p>
