Quick Look is a handy OS X feature where you can get a quick look at a file by selecting it and pressing the space bar. This is handy when looking through snippet files on disk.  [This plugin](http://goo.gl/KLW5t) adds syntax highlighting in Quick Look supporting many common programming languages, and even supports R code.
