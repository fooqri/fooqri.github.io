I have been building a few prototype devices with the following parts:
- <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13024">Intel Edison</a>
- <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13037">Sparkfun Battery Block</a>
- <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13034">Sparkfun I2C Block</>
- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H1OYE4Q">MPU-6050</a>

The device runs a node.js app that handles configuration and also posting data to a web service running in the cloud. Each user has an account and can have 1 or more devices. I won't get into the purpose of the device here (or a few more components it has) but the device is working for its intended early prototyping purpose. One issue is the Edison platform is too expensive to create devices at the price point I am looking for. After some analysis I decided to try an reproduce the behavior of the current device using an ESP8266 instead of the Edison. I ordered some very inexpensive ESP8266 that are coming via the slow boat, but in the mean time my <a href="https://goo.gl/yCnruP">Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing</a> arrived. It is a breakout board featuring the ESP8266.

I hope to get time over the next week to dive into coding the ESP8266, but if anyone has previously hooked up an MPU-6050 to an 8266 I would love to hear about your experiences and any issues, etc.
