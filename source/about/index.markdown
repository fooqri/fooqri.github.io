# Welcome

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find something useful here. This is a place where I share design and development explorations, ideas, and techniques. I also sprinkle in productivity and organizational techniques I find useful.

# About me 

My name is Patrick Goddi and I am a designer _and_ developer living in Silicon Valley. [twitter:@fooqri](http://twitter.com/fooqri), [in:goddip](http://www.linkedin.com/in/goddi/)

What does it mean to be both a designer and developer? One simple answer is, _“That is what I do. I have studied and practiced  both the design and development of products; and directed research, design, and development teams.”_ Although design and development seem very different in practice and process, they are both about problem solving. They simply approach problems from slightly different directions with a different set of tools.  For describing design, I am fond of the following definition:

_Design is a methodology for applying critical thinking to understand, visualize, and describe complex ill-structured problems and develop approaches to solve them._


That is from the _US Army Field Manual_, but I think it fits superbly for defining design for technology products as well. Further, it describes where designers and developers stand on common ground. _Designers and developers both bringing their knowledge, practice, and experience to bear on solving a problem._ They just have different tools and methodologies, but with the right approach, they work in harmony to solve really hard problems.
