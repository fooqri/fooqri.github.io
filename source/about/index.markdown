# Welcome

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you found something useful here. This is a place where I share design and development explorations, ideas, and techniques that others may find useful. I also add productivity and organizational techniques I find useful.

# About me

My name is Patrick Goddi and I am a designer and developer living in Silicon Valley. [twitter:@fooqri](http://twitter.com/fooqri), [in:goddip](http://www.linkedin.com/in/goddi/)

What does it mean to be a designer and developer? One simple answer is, “that is what I do.” I’ve designed and developed products; as well as directed research, design, and development teams. Most people get the development part but get hung up on design; likely because it is somewhat rare to be both a designer and developer, and because design can mean different things to different people. For describing design, I am fond of the following definition:

Design is a methodology for applying critical thinking to understand, visualize, and describe complex ill-structured problems and develop approaches to solve them.

That is from the US Army Field Manual, but I think it fits superbly for defining design for technology products as well. Being able to identify and describe a problem well is possibly the most important part of designing and delivering meaningful and lasting value, whether it be through products, experiences, or some other means. In my time doing research at HP Labs, concise and complete statement of the problem was perhaps the most important skill we used. The first question from anyone in the lab about a new research program or technology prototype was always “What is the hard problem you are trying to solve, and why is the problem important?” Only after answering these questions could one start to discuss the approach to solving the problem or any solution they had developed.

The Army Field Manual definition of design is also more inclusive than common descriptions that draw heavily on aesthetic characteristics of design. Aesthetic design is very important to products and has been an important part of my responsibilities as a design director, but design is much more. The definition also points to the fact that being a great designer is about honing many diverse skills, for there are many ways to solve a problem. For example, in user interface design their is the concept of hierarchy which can be solved using various tools from information design, interaction design, and aesthetic/visual design – specialists from each of these areas will often solve a hierarchy problem in different ways, but without all three skills working together is impossible to achieve an optimal design. The same is true for honing both design and engineering skills, these are both problem solving domains, and without a good understanding of the capabilities of both it is imposible to achieve an optimal design. Even the idea of what is optimal changes with technology innovation.
